Major Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add new *List of Participants* (previously called *Roles*) which
  now shows each person's custom event roles and whether they have
  registered for the event in addition to the the default roles
  (speaker, chairperson, etc.)

Improvements

- Allow specifying a default session for a track which will then be
  used by default when accepting an abstract in that track (:issue:`3069`)

Internal Changes
