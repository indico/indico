Version 3.2.3
-------------

*Released on February 23, 2023*

Security fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Sanitize HTML in global announcement messages
- Update `cryptography <https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/>`_ library due to
  vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (:cve:`CVE-2023-0286`)

  Denial of Service vulnerability (:cve:`CVE-2023-25577`)

.. note::

    The risk of malicious HTML (e.g. scripts) in the global announcement is minimal
    as only Indico administrators can set such an announcement anyway. However, in the
    unlikely case that an administrator becomes malicious or is compromised, they would
    have been be able to perform XSS against their Indico instance.

Version 3.2.1
-------------

*Released on November 10, 2022*

Security fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Update `cryptography <https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/>`_ library due to
  vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (:cve:`CVE-2022-3602`, :cve:`CVE-2022-3786`)

.. note::

    We do not think that Indico is affected by those vulnerabilities as it does
    not use the *cryptography* library itself, and the dependency that uses it
    is only used during SSO (OAuth) logins and most likely in a way that is not
    vulnerable. It is nonetheless recommended to update as soon as possible.

  explicit name, i.e. ``signals.core.foo`` (:pr:`5007`)
- Add ``category.extra_events`` signal (:pr:`5005`, thanks :user:`omegak`)


Version 3.0rc2
--------------

*Released on July 09, 2021*

Major Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add support for personal tokens. These tokens act like OAuth tokens, but are
  associated with a specific user and generated manually without the need of
  doing the OAuth flow. They can be used like API keys but with better granularity
  using the same scopes OAuth applications have, and a single user can have multiple
  tokens using various scopes. By default any user can create such tokens, but admins
  can restrict their creation.
  (:issue:`1934`, :pr:`4976`)

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add abstract content to the abstract list customization options (:pr:`4968`)
- Add CLI option to create a series (:pr:`4969`)
- Users cannot submit multiple anonymous surveys anymore by logging out and in again
  (:issue:`4693`, :pr:`4970`)
- Improve reviewing state display for paper reviewers (:issue:`4979`, :pr:`4984`)
- Make it clearer if the contributions/timetable of a conference are still in draft mode
  (:issue:`4977`, :pr:`4986`)
- Add "send to speakers" option in event reminders (:issue:`4958`, :pr:`4966`, thanks
  :user:`Naveenaidu`)
- Allow displaying all events descending from a category (:issue:`4982`,
  :pr:`4983`, thanks :user:`omegak` and :user:`openprojects`).
- Add an option to allow non-judge conveners to update an abstract track (:pr:`4989`)

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Fix errors when importing events containing abstracts or event roles from a YAML dump
  (:pr:`4995`)
- Fix sorting abstract notification rules (:pr:`4998`)
- No longer silently fall back to the first event contact email address when sending
  registration emails where no explicit sender address has been configured (:issue:`4992`,
  :pr:`4996`, thanks :user:`vasantvohra`)
- Do not check for event access when using a registration link with a registration token
  (:issue:`4991`, :pr:`4997`, thanks :user:`vasantvohra`)


Version 3.0rc1
--------------

*Released on June 25, 2021*

Major Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- There is a new built-in search module which provides basic search functionality out
  of the box, and for more advanced needs (such as full text search in uploaded files)
  plugins can provide their own search functionality (e.g. using ElasticSearch).
  (:pr:`4841`)
- Categories may now contain both events and subcategories at the same time. During the
  upgrade to 3.0 event creation is automatically set to restricted in all categories
  containing subcategories in order to avoid any negative surprises which would suddenly
  allow random Indico users to create events in places where they couldn't do so previously.
  (:issue:`4679`, :pr:`4725`, :pr:`4757`)
- The OAuth provider module has been re-implemented based on a more modern
  library (authlib). Support for the somewhat insecure *implicit flow* has been
  removed in favor of the code-with-PKCE flow. Tokens are now stored more securely
  as a hash instead of plaintext. For a given user/app/scope combination, only a
  certain amount of tokens are stored; once the limit has been reached older tokens
  will be discarded. The OAuth provider now exposes its metadata via a well-known
  URI (RFC 8414) and also has endpoints to introspect or revoke a token. (:issue:`4685`,
  :pr:`4798`)
- User profile pictures (avatars) are now shown in many more places throughout Indico,
  such as user search results, meeting participant lists and reviewing timelines.
  (:issue:`4625`, :pr:`4747`, :pr:`4939`)

Internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New locale: English (United States)
- New translation: Turkish

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use a more modern search dialog when searching for users (:issue:`4674`, :pr:`4743`)
- Add an option to refresh event person data from the underlying user when cloning an
  event (:issue:`4750`, :pr:`4760`)
- Add options for attaching iCal files to complete registration and event reminder
  emails (:issue:`1158`, :pr:`4780`)
- Use the new token-based URLs instead of API keys for persistent ical links and replace
  the calendar link widgets in category, event, session and contribution views with the
  more modern ones used in dashboard (:issue:`4776`, :pr:`4801`)
- Add an option to export editables to JSON (:issue:`4767`, :pr:`4810`)
- Add an option to export paper peer reviewing data to JSON (:issue:`4767`, :pr:`4818`)
- Passwords are now checked against a list of breached passwords ("Have I Been Pwned")
  in a secure and anonymous way that does not disclose any data. If a user logs in with
  an insecure password, they are forced to change it before they can continue using Indico
  (:pr:`4817`)
- Failed login attempts now trigger rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
  (:issue:`1550`, :pr:`4817`)
- Allow filtering the "Participant Roles" page by users who have not registered for the event
  (:issue:`4763`, :pr:`4822`)
- iCalendar exports now include contact data, event logo URL and, when exporting
  sessions/contributions, the UID of the related event. Also, only non-empty fields
  are exported. (:issue:`4785`, :issue:`4586`, :issue:`4587`, :issue:`4791`,
  :pr:`4820`)
- Allow adding groups/roles as "authorized abstract submitters" (:pr:`4834`)
- Direct links to (sub-)contributions in meetings using the URLs usually meant for
  conferences now redirect to the meeting view page (:pr:`4847`)
- Use a more compact setup QR code for the mobile *Indico check-in* app; the latest version of
  the app is now required. (:pr:`4844`)
- Contribution duration fields now use a widget similar to the time picker that makes selecting
  durations easier. (:issue:`2462`, :pr:`4873`)
- Add new meeting themes that show sequential numbers instead of start times for contributions
  (:pr:`4899`)
- Remove the very outdated "Compact style" theme (it's still available via the ``themes_legacy``
  plugin) (:issue:`4900`, :pr:`4899`)
- Support cloning surveys when cloning events (:issue:`2045`, :pr:`4910`)
- Show external contribution references in conferences (:issue:`4928`, :pr:`4933`)
- Allow changing the rating scale in abstract/paper reviewing even after reviewing started (:pr:`4942`)
- Allow blacklisting email addresses for user registrations (:issue:`4644`, :pr:`4946`)

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Take registrations of users who are only members of a custom event role into account on the
  "Participant Roles" page (:pr:`4822`)
- Fail gracefully during registration import when two rows have different emails that belong
  to the same user (:pr:`4823`)
- Restore the ability to see who's inheriting access from a parent object (:pr:`4833`)
- Fix misleading message when cancelling a booking that already started and has past
  occurrences that won't be cancelled (:issue:`4719`, :pr:`4861`)
- Correctly count line breaks in length-limited abstracts (:pr:`4918`)
- Fix error when trying to access subcontributions while event is in draft mode
- Update the user link in registrations when merging two users (:pr:`4936`)
- Fix error when exporting a conference timetable PDF with the option "Print abstract content of all
  contributions" and one of the abstracts is too big to fit in a page (:issue:`4881`, :pr:`4955`)
- Emails sent via the Editing module are now logged to the event log (:pr:`4960`)
- Fix error when importing event notes from another event while the target event already
  has a deleted note (:pr:`4959`)

Internal Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Require Python 3.9 - older Python versions (especially Python 2.7) are **no longer supported**
- ``confId`` has been changed to ``event_id`` and the corresponding URL path segments
  now enforce numeric data (and thus pass the id as a number instead of string)
- ``CACHE_BACKEND`` has been removed; Indico now always uses Redis for caching
- The integration with flower (celery monitoring tool) has been removed as it was not widely used,
  did not provide much benefit, and it is no longer compatible with the latest Celery version
- ``session.user`` now returns the user related to the current request, regardless of whether
  it's coming from OAuth, a signed url or the actual session (:pr:`4803`)
- Add a new ``check_password_secure`` signal that can be used to implement additional password
  security checks (:pr:`4817`)
- Add an endpoint to let external applications stage the creation of an event with some data to be
  pre-filled when the user then opens the link returned by that endpoint (:pr:`4628`, thanks
  :user:`adl1995`)


----


Version 2.3.6
-------------

*Unreleased*

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- None so far :)


Version 2.3.5
-------------

*Released on May 11, 2021*

Security fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix XSS vulnerabilities in the category picker (via category titles), location widget (via room and
  venue names defined by an Indico administrator) and the "Indico Weeks View" timetable theme (via
  contribution/break titles defined by an event organizer). As neither of these objects can be created
  by untrusted users (on a properly configured instance) we consider the severity of this vulnerability
  "minor" (:pr:`4897`)

Internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New translation: Polish
- New translation: Mongolian

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add an option to not disclose the names of editors and commenters to submitters in the
  Paper Editing module (:issue:`4829`, :pr:`4865`)

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Do not show soft-deleted long-lasting events in category calendar (:pr:`4824`)
- Do not show management-related links in editing hybrid view unless the user has
  access to them (:pr:`4830`)
- Fix error when assigning paper reviewer roles with notifications enabled and one
  of the reviewing types disabled (:pr:`4838`)
- Fix viewing timetable entries if you cannot access the event but a specific session
  inside it (:pr:`4857`)
- Fix viewing contributions if you cannot access the event but have explicit access to
  the contribution (:pr:`4860`)
- Hide registration menu item if you cannot access the event and registrations are not
  exempt from event access checks (:pr:`4860`)
- Fix inadvertently deleting a file uploaded during the "make changes" Editing action,
  resulting in the revision sometimes still referencing the file even though it has been
  deleted from storage (:pr:`4866`)
- Fix sorting abstracts by date (:pr:`4877`)

Internal Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add ``before_notification_send`` signal (:pr:`4874`, thanks :user:`omegak`)


Version 2.3.4
-------------

*Released on March 11, 2021*

Security fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix some open redirects which could help making harmful URLs look more trustworthy by linking
  to Indico and having it redirect the user to a malicious site (:issue:`4814`, :pr:`4815`)
- The :data:`BASE_URL` is now always enforced and requests whose Host header does not match
  are rejected. This prevents malicious actors from tricking Indico into sending e.g. a
  password reset link to a user that points to a host controlled by the attacker instead of
  the actual Indico host (:pr:`4815`)

.. note::

    If the webserver is already configured to enforce a canonical host name and redirects or
    rejects such requests, this cannot be exploited. Additionally, exploiting this problem requires
    user interaction: they would need to click on a password reset link which they never requested,
    and which points to a domain that does not match the one where Indico is running.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fail more gracefully is a user has an invalid locale set and fall back to the default
  locale or English in case the default locale is invalid as well
- Log an error if the configured default locale does not exist
- Add ID-1 page size for badge printing (:pr:`4774`, thanks :user:`omegak`)
- Allow managers to specify a reason when rejecting registrants and add a new placeholder
  for the rejection reason when emailing registrants (:pr:`4769`, thanks :user:`vasantvohra`)

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Fix the "Videoconference Rooms" page in conference events when there are any VC rooms
  attached but the corresponding plugin is no longer installed
- Fix deleting events which have a videoconference room attached which has its VC plugin
  no longer installed
- Do not auto-redirect to SSO when an MS office user agent is detected (:issue:`4720`,
  :pr:`4731`)
- Allow Editing team to view editables of unpublished contributions (:issue:`4811`, :pr:`4812`)

Internal Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Also trigger the ``ical-export`` metadata signal when exporting events for a whole category
- Add ``primary_email_changed`` signal (:pr:`4802`, thanks :user:`openprojects`)


Version 2.3.3
-------------

*Released on January 25, 2021*

Security fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- JSON locale data for invalid locales is no longer cached on disk; instead a 404 error is
  triggered. This avoids creating small files in the cache folder for each invalid locale
  that is requested. (:pr:`4766`)

Internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New translation: Ukrainian

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add a new "Until approved" option for a registration form's "Modification allowed"
  setting (:pr:`4740`, thanks :user:`vasantvohra`)

  attached videoconference rooms (:pr:`4732`)


Version 2.3.2
-------------

*Released on November 30, 2020*

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Disable title field by default in new registration forms (:issue:`4688`, :pr:`4692`)
- Add gender-neutral "Mx" title (:issue:`4688`, :pr:`4692`)
- Add contributions placeholder for emails (:pr:`4716`, thanks :user:`bpedersen2`)
- Show program codes in contribution list (:pr:`4713`)
- Display the target URL of link materials if the user can access them (:issue:`2599`,
  :pr:`4718`)
- Show the revision number for all revisions in the Editing timeline (:pr:`4708`)

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Only consider actual speakers in the "has registered speakers" contribution list filter
  (:pr:`4712`, thanks :user:`bpedersen2`)
- Correctly filter events in "Sync with your calendar" links (this fix only applies to newly
  generated links) (:pr:`4717`)
- Correctly grant access to attachments inside public sessions/contribs even if the event
  is more restricted (:pr:`4721`)

  thanks :user:`bpedersen2`)
- Fix error when rescheduling a survey that already has submissions (:issue:`4730`)


Version 2.3.1
-------------

*Released on October 27, 2020*

Security fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fix potential data leakage between OAuth-authenticated and unauthenticated HTTP API requests
  for the same resource (:pr:`4663`)

.. note::

    Due to OAuth access to the HTTP API having been broken until this version, we do not
    believe this was actually exploitable on any Indico instance. In addition, only Indico
    administrators can create OAuth applications, so regardless of the bug there is no risk
    for any instance which does not have OAuth applications with the ``read:legacy_api``
    scope.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Generate material packages in a background task to avoid timeouts or using excessive
  amounts of disk space in case of people submitting several times (:pr:`4630`)
- Add new :data:`EXPERIMENTAL_EDITING_SERVICE` setting to enable extending an event's Editing
  workflow through an `OpenReferee server <https://github.com/indico/openreferee/>`_ (:pr:`4659`)

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Only show the warning about draft mode in a conference if it actually has any
  contributions or timetable entries
- Do not show incorrect modification deadline in abstract management area if no
  such deadline has been set (:pr:`4650`)

  ``registration_created`` and ``registration_updated`` signals (:pr:`4642`,
  thanks :user:`omegak`)
- Add ``logged_in`` signal


Version 2.3
-----------

*Released on September 14, 2020*

.. note::

    We also published a `blog post <https://getindico.io/indico/update/release/milestone/2020/07/22/indico-2-3-news.html>`_
    summarizing the most relevant changes for end users.

Major Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add category roles, which are similar to local groups but within the
  scope of a category and its subcategories. They can be used for assigning
  permissions in any of these categories and events within such categories.
- Events marked as "Invisible" are now hidden from the category's event list
  for everyone except managers (:issue:`4419`, thanks :user:`openprojects`)
- Introduce profile picture, which is for now only visible on the user dashboard
  (:issue:`4431`, thanks :user:`omegak`)
- Registrants can now be added to event ACLs. This can be used to easily restrict
  parts of an event to registered participants. If registration is open and a registration
  form is in the ACL, people will be able to access the registration form even if they
  would otherwise not have access to the event itself. It is also possible to restrict
  individual event materials and custom page/link menu items to registered participants.
  (:issue:`4477`, :issue:`4528`, :issue:`4505`, :issue:`4507`)
- Add a new Editing module for papers, slides and posters which provides a workflow
  for having a team review the layout/formatting of such proceedings and then publish
  the final version on the page of the corresponding contribution. The Editing module
  can also be connected to an external microservice to handle more advanced workflows
  beyond what is supported natively by Indico.
