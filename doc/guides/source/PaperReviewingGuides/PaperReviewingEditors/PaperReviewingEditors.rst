 When you access the layout reviewers area you will find a list of all the contributions
 that are assigned to you for judgement. You also see the state of every contribution.

 First you should fill in the questions provided by the paper review manager, after this,
 you can give your judgement for the layout of the contribution: ``to be corrected``, ``rejected``,
 ``accepted``. The comments that you write should help the referee to give his judgement.
 The authors of the contribution will receive an automatic e-mail notification containing your comments
 and judgement, if the managers of the paper reviewing set this option.

 The material which is the subject of reviewing is accessible for the editor from the ``Material to Review`` tab. The editor
 can edit, delete the current material and upload more files only if the files are submitted and under review.

 Otherwise the file list will be disabled for editing, removing and adding.
