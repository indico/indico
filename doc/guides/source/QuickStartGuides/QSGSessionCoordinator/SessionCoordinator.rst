Session Co-ordinator's Guide
==============================

--------------------
Session Co-ordinator
--------------------

The Session Co-ordinator is responsible for scheduling
contributions and breaks within his session. These contributions
need to be imported by the Session Manager or Conference Manager
before you can add them to your session.

You are given this co-ordinator access by either the Session
Manager or the Conference Manager. The Conference Manager sets the
level of modification rights for all of the Session Co-ordinators.
You can access your session by selecting *My session* from the
conference menu.

Conference Manager can give to Session Co-ordinators, as we will

session you will be presented with this page:

conference manager immediately.
