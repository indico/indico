You can access your tracks by selecting *My tracks* or *Manage my
tracks* from the conference homepage menu under *My conference* or *Scientific
Programme*. This will take you to the list of tracks you are
co-ordinating or straight into your track if you co-ordinate only one
track.

If you click on an abstract's name you will be taken to the
Abstract's Management area. From here you can view the abstract's
details and propose whether you want to accept, reject, mark as
duplicated, or suggest the abstract for another track.
Depending on the setup of the Abstract Module, a track coordinator can be able
to directly accept or reject the abstract.

------------

Main Tab
^^^^^^^^

This is where you can modify the main details of the abstract, and also
see some information as for instance submitter, status, etc.
It is also from here where a track coordinator can propose the abstract to
be accepted, rejected, for another track and mark as duplicated (see next

accept or reject the abstract directly.
