The Submitter is able to submit material for a
contribution. You are given Submitter access by either the
Conference Manager, Session Manager, Contribution Manager or
possibly the Session Co-ordinator.

You can access the contributions for which you can submit material
by selecting *My contributions* from the menu in the event homepage.
This will take you to your submission area and will list the
contributions for which you can submit material.

By clicking on *Add Material* link a new popup will appear from
which you can choose the material type (slides, video etc.) and upload it.
You also need to set the protection level, (see :ref:`access_control`), and
you can add a description and display name. If you set the material to be private,
a *Protection* tab will appear, where you can add users or groups that
are allowed to access your material, set the visibility (hidden, visible)
and if you wish, set an access key.

Once the material has been submitted it will appear in the
contribution details
