Lecture
-------

A Lecture is the simplest form of event within Indico. The following modules can be found in a lecture:

* General settings: Set the general settings of the conference
* Material: Attach material to the lecture (slides, videos etc.)
* Participants: You can add all the participants for the Meeting or you can
  open the participation so users can apply for it
* Evaluation: You can set an evaluation form to be completed by the participants
* Protection: Set the access protection of the lecture
* Tools: Where you can set alarms, lock/delete/clone the lecture, etc.
* Logs: List of all the actions performed on the whole of the lecture


--------------

Creating a Lecture
------------------

If you have the correct access rights within a category, you can create
a new lecture by clicking on *Create event* then *Lecture* from the blue
top bar. You will be presented with a form similar to that for a Meeting.
You will need to choose a category in which to create your lectures, then
the basic information; you can choose the default style in which the
Lecture will be displayed `(See Lecture Display Area) <#lecture-display-area>`_.
Set the access protection and click on *Create lecture*; you are done.
You will be redirected to the Lecture Management Area.

--------------

Lecture Management Area
-----------------------

The Management Area allows you to control the different parts of
your lecture. The following sections will show all the options in the
Lecture Management Area.

--------------

General Settings Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In *General settings*, you can: edit the title, place, start/end date,
timezone, default style (see :ref:`lecture_display_area` ), visibility (see :ref:`general_settings` for conferences), event type, keywords.
You can add a description to your lecture, a support email and its caption
(which will appear on the event page), organizers and a short display URL
(used as a shortcut to the lecture’s event page). You can also add or remove speakers.

|image141|

Clicking on the button *Switch to event page* will take you to the
home page of your event.

--------------

Material
~~~~~~~~

You can add material to the lecture, by using the *Material* menu, and
the link *Add Material*.
You can then enter the name and description of the material.

|image144|

The material can be files or links. You also protect the material
to control who has access to view it.

--------------

~~~~~~~~~

If the Indico administrators have enabled the chat room module, you can create
chat rooms for your lecture.

If the Indico administrators have enabled the Video Services functionality, you can have access to the *Video Services*
option. The tabs in Video Services are:

* Videoconferencing: Set up a videoconference
* Recording request: Once you've set up the location of the lecture, you
  can do a recording request. You will be presented to a form to complete
  and you will need to ensure that all speakers
  have given their permission to have their talks recorded.

  form, select a room capable of webcasting and ensure that all speakers
  give their permission to have their talks webcasted
* Managers: Here you add video services managers and managers for individual
  systems

For more information, see :ref:`video_guide`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view here a list of all the participants. One can add or remove
participants (as a manager), mark as present/absent, ask for excuse, send
email, export the list of participants to Excel, among other options.

For more info see `Meeting participants <Meetings.html#participants>`_.

-----------

.. _evaluation:

Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~

You can set an evaluation form to be completed by the participants. There
are four tabs in this option:

|image162|

* Setup: Where you set the basic details, such as evaluation start/end date,
  max. number of submissions etc. You enable and disable the form by clicking
  on *Show*/*Hide*. You also have special actions, such as export or import
  the evaluation etc.
* Edit: This is where you create the evaluation form. You can add a textbox,
  textarea, password, select, radio or checkbox question.
* Preview: This shows you a preview of your evaluation form. Feel free to
  try it, any form submitted from here will not be taken into account.
* Results: Results of the evaluation

For more on the evaluation process, go to :ref:`event_evaluation`


Protection Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Protection Management in a lecture is the same as that in a Meeting.
There is Modification Control, Domain Control and Access Control.
When adding to the Access and Modification lists, you can also add
Groups of users if any have been defined by Administration.

*Modification Control* Only the managers listed in the
modification control, the creator of the lecture, and any
administrators can access the Management Area of the lecture.
However, you can add a Modification Key which means anyone with this
key can modify the lecture without logging in.

|image145|

*Access Control* When the lecture is public, anyone can view the
lecture . When the lecture is private, only those in the access
list, lecture managers, and administrators can view the lecture.
When it is inheriting, it has the same access protection as its parent
category. Changing the access protection of its parent category will
change the access protection of the lecture.

If the lecture access is  PRIVATE the event manager will be able to set a
'Contact in case of no access', so users with no access will know who to contact
in order to request access.

Also when private you can also add an Access Key which means anyone
with this key can access the lecture without logging in.

|image146|

If the lecture is PUBLIC and has some element that is RESTRICTED, there will
show a message 'Some parts of it are, however, protected. Which ones?'. If you
click in 'Which ones?' it will show a popup with the children protected. The same
works when the lecture access is RESTRICTED and has PUBLIC elements.

|image167|

*Domain Control* This is available when the lecture is
public. You can specify which domain can access the lecture. For
instance, choosing CERN as a domain means only users accessing
from a computer in the CERN domain will be able to access.


--------------

Tools Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lecture Tools allow you to carry out certain actions on the whole
of the lecture.

--------------


Alarm Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set an alarm/reminder in the same way as it's done for conferences; see :ref:`conference_alarms`.

--------------

Cloning a Lecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the lecture if you would like to make another lecture exactly the
same. You have the option to clone it once, at fixed intervals,
or on certain dates.

|image149|

For more explanation on the cloning process, see :ref:`clone_event` for
conferences.

----------------

Posters
^^^^^^^

As for meetings, you can create posters for your lecture. You can either
create your own, or use a local template.

|image163|

-------------

Lock
^^^^

It is possible to lock the lecture. If you lock the event, you won’t be
able to change its details anymore. Only the creator of the lecture or
an administrator of the system/category can unlock an event. You will be
asked to confirm.

|image164|

--------------

Deleting a Lecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Delete option will delete the whole lecture. There is no undo tool
so far, but you will be asked to confirm deletion beforehand.

|image148|

--------------

Material Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the *Material Package* option you can create a package
of all the materials that have been used in the lecture.

|image150|

--------------

Create an Offline version of a Lecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create an offline copy of a lecture in the same way it's done for conferences; see :ref:`offline_conference`.

--------------


.. _lecture_display_area:

Lecture Display Area
--------------------

The Lecture Display is the view that users of the lecture will
see. If the lecture is public they will not need to log in to view
the lecture. It is also the area in which you can access the
modification areas if you have access rights. There are various
views in which the lecture can be displayed; the following sections
show the different views and displays of the different parts of a
lecture.

--------------

Lecture Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default view for lectures in Indico. If you have
modification rights to any parts in the lecture, you will be able
to access the Management Area by clicking the modification icon |image155|.

You can also do some management actions from the tab *Manage* on the right
of the title.
