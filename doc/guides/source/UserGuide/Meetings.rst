Meeting
-------

A Meeting is not as in depth as a Conference and is made
for smaller events. Within a Meeting you can find the modules:

* General settings: Where you  can manage the general settings of the
  meeting (e.g. title, location etc.)
* Timetable: In which you can directly add Sessions, Contributions, and Breaks.
* Material: Where you can upload material that will be attached to the
  meeting. The material can be slides, videos, minutes etc.
* Participants: you can add all the participants for the Meeting or you
  can open the participation so users can apply for it.
* Evaluation: You can submit an evaluation form to be completed by the
  participants. You can set the questions, edit the form and the results
  and preview it in the different tabs available
* Lists: Relevant lists of users, such as list of all sessions’ conveners etc
* Protection: Set the access control for the meeting
* Tools: Where you can set alarms, clone the conference etc.
* Logs: List of all the actions performed on the whole of the meeting


--------------

Creating a Meeting
------------------

To create a meeting, click on *Create* -> *Meeting* in the top blue menu
bar. You will be presented with a form you need to complete. First, you
need to choose the category in which your meeting will be created. Then,
enter the basic information (title, start/end date etc.); you can choose
the default style in which the Meeting will be displayed `(see Meeting Display Area)
<#meeting-display-area>`_. Finally, set the access protection. Click on *Create meeting*.
You will be redirected to the meeting's Management Area.

--------------

Meeting Management Area
-----------------------

The Management Area allows you to control the different parts of
your meeting. The following sections will show each option of the
Meeting Management Area.

Clicking on the link *Switch to event page* will take you to the
event page of the meeting.

--------------

General Settings Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In General Settings, you can edit the title, description, place, start/end
date, timezone, default style, event type. You can add a support e-mail
and modify its caption; it will be displayed in the event page. It is also
possible to create a short display URL, used as a shortcut to the event page.
You have the possibility of changing the default style, `(see Meeting Display Area)
<#meeting-display-area>`_  . To edit the visibility, see visibility in :ref:`general_settings`
for conferences. Finally, you can add or remove any chairpersons.

--------------

Timetable Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Timetable Management allows you to organize your meeting by
using sessions (groups of contributions), contributions (presentations),
and breaks.

The management of the timetable is the same as for conferences. The
only difference is while adding contributions. In conferences, you can
add unscheduled contributions to the timetable. In meetings, unscheduled
contributions don't exist, therefore you will always need to create the contribution.

Here, we will just explain how to create contributions. For more details and
further explanations about the Timetable Management `see Timetable Management
for Conferences <Conferences.html#timetable-management>`_.

--------------

Adding Contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can directly add contributions into your timetable using the
*Add new* > *Contribution* at the top of the timetable. This will open
a pop-up with a form to create a new contribution.

|image103|

Within this form, you can define the name, description, location,
presenters, the starting time and duration of this contribution.

|image104|

In order to edit the contribution, you can click on it and a edition balloon
will show up. In this balloon, you can modify the timing or the whole
contribution.

Participant list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this tab, one can view the list of all the participants. You can add or remove
participants (as a manager), mark as present/absent, ask for excuse, send
email etc. You can also export the list of participants to Excel by clicking
on the Excel icon on the button bar.

The event manager can add participants in the two following ways:

-----------------

Manager adds participants
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

In order to add participants, click on

* *Add* >*Indico User* if the participant or the e-group exists in Indico database;
* Otherwise, click on *Add->New user*.

|image154|

-----------------

Manager invites participants
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To do so, click on *Add* > *Invite*. The participant(s) invited will receive an
email informing them they have been invited to an event. This email will
contain a link they will have to use to accept/reject the invitation.

|image155|

When they will open the link, the following window will appear:

|image159|

They will then need to click on *Accept* or *Reject*.

------------------

Pending list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As explained in `Setup <#setup>`_ you can setup the approval to be made by the event managers.

Users will be able to apply from the event page, by clicking on *Apply here*.

|image157|

A window will appear:

|image158|

To apply, you will need to click on *Ok*

If the manager chooses to approve the requests for participation, he will
see the tab *Pending* highlighted:

|image160|

To accept or reject a request, he will need to click on the tab
and the following window will appear, where he can manage the requests.
When you reject an application you can choose whether to send an email or not.

|image161|

Declined list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Logs
~~~~

See :ref:`logs_management` for Conferences

-------------

Protection Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Protection in a meeting is the same as in a Conference.
There is Modification Control, Domain Control, and Access Control.
When adding to the Access and Modification lists, you can also add
Groups of users if any have been defined by Administration.

*Modification Control* Only the managers listed in the
modification control, the creator of the meeting, and any
administrators can access the Management Area of the meeting.
However, you can add a Modification Key which means anyone with this
key can modify the meeting without logging in.

|image119|

*Access Control* When the meeting is public, anyone can view the
meeting including the details, timetable, material, etc. When the
meeting is private, only those in the access list, meeting
managers, and administrators can view the meeting. When it is inheriting,
its access protection will be the same as its parent category. Changing
the access protection of the parent category will change the access protection
of the meeting (see :ref:`access_control`)

|image120|

If the meeting is PUBLIC and has some element that is RESTRICTED, there will
show a message 'Some parts of it are, however, protected. Which ones?'. If you
click in 'Which ones?' it will show a popup with the children protected. The same
works when the meeting access is RESTRICTED and has PUBLIC elements.

|image165|

If the meeting access is  RESTRICTED the event manager will be able to set a
'Contact in case of no access', so users with no access will know who to contact
in order to request access.

Also, when private you can also add an Access Key which means anyone
with this key can access the meeting without logging in.


*Domain Control* This is available for public meetings. It allows you
to specify which domain can access the meeting. For instance, choosing
CERN will mean the meeting is only accessible for people inside the
CERN domain.

*Material Visibility* By default a material will always be
visible in the timetable, even if it is private (the user will
be redirected to a login screen or access key prompt when clicking
on it). You can force the material to be hidden for non-authorized
people by using the *Visibility to unauthorized users* section in
the material access control page.

--------------

Tools Tab
~~~~~~~~~

The meeting Tools allow you to make certain actions on the whole
of the meeting. See following sub-sections.

--------------

Alarm Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set an alarm/reminder in the same way as it's done for conferences; see :ref:`conference_alarms`.

--------------

.. _clone_meeting:

Cloning a Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the meeting if you would like to make another meeting exactly the
same. You have the option to clone it once, at fixed intervals,
or on certain dates. For more on cloning, see :ref:`clone_event` for conferences.

|image123|

--------------

Posters
^^^^^^^

You have the possibility of creating posters for your meetings. You can
create your own, or create one from a template.

|image146|

--------------

Lock
^^^^

It is possible to lock the meeting. If you lock the event, you won’t be
able to change its details anymore. Only the creator of the meetings or
an administrator of the system/category can unlock an event. You will be
asked to confirm.

|image121|

--------------

Deleting a Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Delete meeting option will delete the whole meeting. You will
be asked to confirm deletion beforehand.

|image122|

-------------

Packaging Material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the *Material package* option you can create a package
of all the materials that have been used in the meeting.

|image124|

--------------

Create an Offline version of a Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create an offline copy of a meeting in the same way it's done for conferences; see :ref:`offline_conference`.

--------------

Meeting Display Area
--------------------

The Meeting Display is the view that users of the meeting will
see. If the meeting is public they will not need to log in to view
it. It is also the area in which you can access the
modification areas if you have access rights. There are various
views/styles in which the meeting can be displayed; the following sections
show the different views and displays.

--------------

Indico Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default view for meetings in Indico. If you have
modification rights to any parts of the meeting you will be able
to access the Management Area by clicking the icon |image133|.

|image134|

You can see a bunch of additional buttons next to the navigation options
on the top left of the page:

The Compact style:

|image138|

You can pass extra parameters to this compact style in order to choose the amount of days to display in one row and the start
and end date. The parameters are:

* daysPerRow: number of days that you want to show per row (as a table row).
* firstDay: first day to be shown (must have the format 1-January-2010)
* lastDay: last day to be shown (must have the format 3-January-2010)

Let's suppose you have a 2 weeks meeting:

http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=XXXX&view=nicecompact (where XXXX is the ID of your meeting)

and you want to display in the 1st row the 1st week and just underneath the second week, you can do it adding the extra paramenter daysPerRow as follows:

http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=XXXX&view=nicecompact&daysPerRow=7 (where XXXX is the ID of your meeting)
