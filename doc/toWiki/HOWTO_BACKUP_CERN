Indico backup guide at CERN
===========================

0. Purpose of this document

    This document contains details about the backup policy set up at CERN
for the Indico system. You'll find detailed instructions about how the backups
are performed and how the Indico system can be restored in case of trouble or 
just for "archiving" purposes (looking at older versions of the data). 


1. General concerns
    
    Before reading this document, please have a look at the Indico document 
HOWTO_BACKUP in order to have a general knowledge about how to backup an Indico 
system and the problem it represents.
    Please, take a look at the document MAINTENANCE_CERN for the details about
how the Indico software is installed at CERN.
    

2. Backup
    
    At CERN the backup is done using IT service which takes care of it, all we
have to do it take care of installing the client and schedule the backup. This
is already done by the group system administrator (Tibor) and the indico 
directories are already targeted to be backuped so we don't need to worry about
this. Both the DB and the archive are in the same machine so the 
synchronisation among them should represent no problem at all as they are 
backuped at the same time. Both the indico archive and db are on pcdh94:/data04
and this directory should be backuped by the IT services.

2.1. DB backup

    In order to ensure a good backup of the DB file, a "hot copy" of it is done
using the script "repozo.py" (see [1] for more info). We use the script 
pcdh94:/soft/bin/indico_db_backup for launching the backup. This script is
scheduled as a cronjob by the root user to run dayly just before midnight. It 
performs a full backup of the db and gzips it under the directory 
pcdh94:/data04/zodb-backup

2.2. Archive backup

    The archive directory is backuped by the IT service thing as a normal 
directory structure.


4. Restoring

    In order to restore an old copy of Indico at CERN we need to follow the 
following steps:
    i) restore from the backuping service the version of pcdh94:/data04 that 
needs to be recovered on a local directory. Please read carefully Tibor's 
doc [1] in order to know what needs to be done; for example:

$ sudo /usr/dsm/dsmc restore "/data04/MaKaC/archive/" -subdir=yes /tmp/mydir/archive
$ sudo /usr/dsm/dsmc restore "/data04/MaKaC/zodb-bakup/" -subdir=yes /tmp/mydir/bk
    
    
    ii) replace the archive directory structure with the restored one by simply
copying the restored directories to the archive path 
(pcdh94:/data04/MaKaC/archive); for example:

$ cp -R /tmp/mydir/bk/* /data04/MaKaC/archive/

    iii) restore the db from the backup directory using "repozo"; for example:
$ /soft/bin/python2.3 /soft/python/bin/repozo.py -R -o data.fs

    iv) copy the db to the destination path.
    v) start the db server.
    vi) restart apache
    vii) everything should work fine.

    Please, keep in mind that the DB needs to run with a compatible version of
the Indico code (for more info see document HOWTO_BACKUP), so you better restore
the Indico code which has been backuped at the time the DB was and make it run 
with it. If you want to restore older copies, you will have to see the version
correspondence in the file pcdh94:/home/hsanchez/Indico_install.txt and fecth
the right code version from the CVS repository and do the necessary migrations 
(this file will be abolished when we set up a way to tag the DB with the last
sw version used).
