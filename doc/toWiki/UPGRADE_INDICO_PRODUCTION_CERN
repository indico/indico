Upgrade of the Indico package on the production machine
=======================================================

0. Purpose of this document

The aim of this document is trying to describe and stablish a standard 
procedure which should be followed when upgrading the Indico sw which is 
running for production at CERN.
Aspects about third party component installation and maintenance are not 
covered here as they are already described in another document [2].

1. Current Indico infrastructure at CERN

Nowadays, Indico system is running at CERN for production purposes (some 
conferences are already using it for real) at one single machine: 
pcdh94.cern.ch.
Another machine, pcdh91.cern.ch, holding exactly the same system as the 
production one runs an Indico prototype having the last features even if this
involves non-stable releases. This is a development machine which can be used 
for testing purposes so the upgrading procedure can be tested before doing so 
in the production one. This machine should always have the same system (linux 
kernel, apache, mod_python, python,  python 3rd party modules) as the 
production one.


2. Considerations before upgrading

Upgrading the Indico production system is a very sensitive process and specially
delicated because on one side Indico is living in the same machine (and using
the same HTTP server) other very important production system is running (CDS 
Agenda); on the other side, it is a system which is being used for real (that's
why we call it 'production') so any interruption may cause troubles to people
which need to use the system. 
This means that the upgrading process should be done with a lot of care and 
attention, always having the possibility to easily restore the old system in 
case something goes wrong.
For this purpose, here you are some directives one must follow:
    i) Before upgrading the system, please make sure the new one resulting
        from an installation process is going to work in the production machine
        with the current DB. For this purpose, before tagging a new release of
        the system, one must make sure that the new version will work with the 
        production DB and in the production machine; for the former issue, it 
        is advisable to make a copy of the production DB and make it run
        with the new release; for the later, cdsdev is a machine which should
        have exaclty the same system as cdsdoc, so prior to installing to cdsdoc
        the upgrading should be done to cdsdev and one must verify everything 
        works smoothly.


3. How to generate a release distribution

Once we know which release we want to install and we are sure the release will
cause no problem in the production server, an installation distribution must
be created. Currently there is no special upgrading procedure; all we have to do
is installing the new release as it was a new system.
In order to generate a release distribution we must use the "distutils" [1] 
setup script provided with Indico (can be found in indico/code/dist/setup.py).
Please note that the distribution generation procedure still needs to be 
improved so it still contains some manual steps that should be automated in 
the future.
These steps must be followed in order to generate a new distribution package:
    i) check out in your machine the module "indico/code" related with the
        tag associated with the release for which you want to generate the 
        distribution.
    ii) edit the file "indico/code/code/MaKaC/common/general.py" and make sure
        the variable "DEBUG_ERRORS" is set to "1" or "True".
    iii) copy inside the directory "indico/code/code" the directory 
        "indico/code/resources/images" and its contents.
    iv) copy inside the directory "indico/code/code" the files:
            "indico/code/dist/README"
            "indico/code/dist/MANIFEST.in"
            "indico/code/dist/setup.py"
            "indico/code/dist/MaKaCConfig.src"
    v) edit the file "indico/code/code/setup.py" and change the version
        number (invocation to "setup" function, parameter "version") to the one 
        you are generating.
    vi) run the "indico/code/code/setup.py" script with parameters 
        "sdist --format=tar" (i.e. indico/code/code/setup.py sdist --format=tar).
    vii) the new distribution can be found in 
        "indico/code/code/dist/MaKaC-X.X.X.tar" corresponding "X.X.X" to the
        version number for which the distribution was generated.


4. How to install a new release 

Please, remember that before installing a new release in the production server
it must be fully tested and one must be sure that the installation will cause
no trouble in the production machine with the production DB.
Once a distribution has been generated for the version we want to install, the
following steps must be followed:
    i) copy the Indico distribution package to production machine (cdsdoc).
    ii) untar the distribution (tar -xvf).
    iii) edit the MaKaC-X.X.X/setup.py and set the following variables:
            htdocsDir = "/soft/httpd/host/indico/htdocs/"
            archiveDir = "/data04/MaKaC/archive"
            tempUploadedFilesDir = "/tmp"
    iv) edit the MaKaC-X.X.X/MaKaCConfig.src and set the configuration 
        parameters as they currently are in the current Indico configuration
        file 
        (/soft/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages/MaKaC/common/MaKaCConfig.py).
        Nowadays they should be set as follows:
            DB_params = ("cdsdoc.cern.ch", 9675)
            URL_base = "http://indico.cern.ch"
            supportEmail = "indico-project@cern.ch"
            XMLAbstractPath = "/data04/bk/"
    v) having root privileges, execute MaKaC-X.X.X/setup.py script using 
        "install" as parameter (sudo /soft/bin/python2.3 setup.py install).
    vi) restart Apache HTTP server (sudo /soft/bin/apache-ctl restart).
Important: It is quite advisable to make a copy of the current MaKaC package
    before installing (step v) the new one just in case something goes wrong
    (although this should never happen as the distribution must be tested 
    before installing) with the installation and the system doesn't work. For 
    doing this you must copy (having root privileges) the directories 
    /soft/httpd/host/indico/htdocs/ and 
    /soft/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages/MaKaC to a local place and restore
    them immediately if something goes wrong after the new installation so the 
    problem can be investigated in other machine without interrupting the 
    production system.
