The official website of Indico is `getindico.io <https://getindico.io>`_, there
you can find useful information related to the project.

IRC

We use IRC as our main means of communication among the development team. Get in
touch through the official `#indico <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=indico>`_
channel on Freenode (irc.freenode.net).
It is also accessible through `Matrix <https://riot.im/app/#/room/#indico:matrix.org>`_.

For more elaborate questions and discussions we encourage you to use our
`discussion forum <https://talk.getindico.io>`_.

Issue tracker

We use `GitHub issues <https://github.com/indico/indico/issues>`_ for specific bug reports and
feature requests. Support enquiries are better suited for the IRC channel or the forums.

Indico has an official Twitter account, `@getindico <https://twitter.com/getindico>`_
