Except for minor differences, this guide applies to both Debian and Ubuntu.
It has been tested with Debian 10 (Buster) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal).

.. warning::
    Older distributions may work, but they are unsupported. We do not recommend
    using those unless you have a strong reason for it and the necessary system
    administration knowledge to know how to deal with compatibility issues should
    any arise.
