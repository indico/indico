We provide guides to install Indico on CentOS and Debian systems.
While other distributions are not officially supported, they should
work fine, but the installation steps (especially package names) may
need some slight adjustments.

Our guides cover a single-machine installation where Indico, Celery,
Redis and PostgreSQL run on the same machine.  This should be fine for
almost all Indico instances, but adapting the steps to multiple machines
is not particularly hard either.
