# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Indico uses the second part of the version number for major feature releases, ie.
3.1, 3.2, ...

**Bugfixes are generally only released for the latest major version (e.g. 3.1.1 to
fix bugs discovered in 3.1).**

**For security releases we usually follow the same schema.** In exceptional cases
where the previous version (e.g. 3.0) is still somewhat recent and thus widely
used AND no suitable workarounds exist, we may also create a patch release for
that version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
