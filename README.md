## I just want to try it out!

We've got a [Sandbox](https://sandbox.getindico.io)üß™!

## Browser support

These are the minimum versions of major browsers currently supported by Indico. We try to target all modern browsers as
much as possible, but only issues detected on those will be considered at critical level.

<!-- BROWSERS - this is all machine-generated! Don't change it. -->

## Roadmap

The full roadmap is [available on the project site](https://getindico.io/roadmap/).

## Community

The main meeting points for the community are:
 * the [Project Forum](https://talk.getindico.io);
 * the Chat Room
([#indico on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=indico) or on [Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#indico:matrix.org)).

We follow [CERN's Values](https://hr-dep.web.cern.ch/content/cern-values-0) and the principles established by
[CERN's Code of Conduct](https://hr-dep.web.cern.ch/content/code-of-conduct).

## History

This software project was initially funded by the European Union's FP5 programmeüá™üá∫, in what was called the [**In**tegrated **Di**gital **Co**nferencing Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/61849/factsheet/en), or just **InDiCo**. CERN was responsible for the development of the "Make-a-Confererence" workpackage (inspired by an already existing system called **CDS Agenda**, also developed at the Organization) which would then become what we nowadays know as **Indico**.

We have since stopped using the ~~*InDiCo*~~ acronym, as it no longer reflects accurately the nature of the project. The word *Indico* now has no particular meaning other than the product's name.
