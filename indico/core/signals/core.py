only ``import`` these modules and do nothing else.

Lets you add extra fields to a form.  The *sender* is the form class

The signal handler should return one or more ``'name', Field`` tuples.
Each field will be added to the form as ``ext__<name>`` and is
automatically excluded from the form's `data` property and its
`populate_obj` method.

To actually process the data, you can use e.g. the `form_validated`
signal and then store it in `flask.g` until another signal informs
you that the operation the user was performing has been successful.

Triggered when an IndicoForm was validated successfully.  The *sender*

recommended to mark a field as erroneous or indicate the error in some
other way.
