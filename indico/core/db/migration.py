We have two dictionaries

    - globalname_dict: We declare the classes that are going to be moved or renamed.
                       The key is the name to be renamed or moved.
                       The value is a tuple with the new module name and the new class; it can have only one value
                       or both.
    - modulename_dict: We declare the modules that are going to be moved.
                       The key is the old module's name and if it finishes with '.' means that
                       that module and all submodules are going to be moved.
                       The value is the new module and also follows the same rules as the key.
