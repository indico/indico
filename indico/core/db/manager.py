        use this class in order to obtain a shelf) and some mechanism to
        ensure there is only one connection opened to the DB during a single
        request.
        This class must not be instantiated, an instance can be obtained
        though the "getInstance" method (implements the singleton pattern
        to ensure unicity)
        Needs to be checked if the class (static) attribute _instance is
        thread-safe: as it is shared by all the objects of this class,
        it could provoke concurrency troubles having 2 threads using the db
        connection at the same time. However, the model under which we are
        programming is not multi-threaded (mod_python seems to run different
        interpreters for each apache subprocess, see mod_python doc section
        4.1) so this thechnique can be used. This has to be taken into account
        when migrating the system to a multi-threading environment.
