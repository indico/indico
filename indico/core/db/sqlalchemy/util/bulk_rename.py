"""
Bulk-renaming utility for constraints/indexes, intended to be used
in alembic migrations.

The `bulk_rename` method takes a mapping of this form::

    mapping = {
        'SCHEMA.TABLE': {
            'indexes': {
                'OLDNAME': 'NEWNAME',
            },
            'constraints': {
                'OLDNAME': 'NEWNAME',
            }
        }
    }

The *indexes* dict contains the primary key and indexes, while the
*constraints* dict includes foreign keys, unique and check constraints.

# TODO: remove this module before releasing 2.0 when removing all the alembic revisions from the 1.9 era
# Indico 2.0 should come with a clean revision list!
