<h4>2.4.2.1. Sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#sessions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A session is essentially a time interval within which you organise many
presentations of your conference. You can create sessions based on different reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You could use a session for each track, for example.</li>
<li>There can also be more than one session scheduled at the same time (parallel sessions).</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new session, click on <em>Add new</em> and <em>Session</em> at the top

new session or add a block to an already existing session (if there is
already at least one session in your timetable).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a new session: You will need to give it a title, choose the duration and a date and time. You can then complete the following criteria (optional): you can add a description, change the location, add conveners etc.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Add another block to: You can choose to add another block to an already existing session. You will first need to choose to what session you want to add a block. You can then choose the time, date, location, add a convener, etc. This means the same session will be happening in different time intervals. For example, you can have a morning interval, then a break, then an afternoon interval within the same session. Another example is having a session on a particular subject one day, and on another subject a few days later.</li>

<p>A session can happen in different intervals of time.
If you already have a session (which will be like the first block)
and you want to add more blocks for that session, you can do it from
the menu (in the top bar of the timetable)  <em>Add new</em> &gt; <em>Session</em>  &gt;
<em>Add another block to:</em> an already existing session.</p>
<p>However, this is optional, blocks can be used when the session takes
place over more than one period of time. For example, you may have a
morning block, then a break, and then an afternoon block within the
same session. Also, you may have one day you have a session on a particular
subject for a couple of hours and then two days later you may have another
session on that subject.</p>

<p>If you choose to delete a contribution and this contribution has been
created/added from the <em>Contributions</em> option on the left menu, then it
will be deleted from the timetable, but will remain in the contributions
list under the <em>Contributions</em> option.</p>
<p>To edit a contribution:</p>
<p>Click on the entry in the timetable, an edition balloon will show up. You
then need to click on <em>Edit</em>. You will be redirected to the  contribution&#8217;s

an hour earlier at 09:00 and the <cite>SHIFT</cite> key was held, the difference of one
hour earlier would be applied to all (and <em>only</em>) contributions and sessions

<h3>2.4.5. Registration Management<a class="headerlink" href="#registration-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You may wish to have some kind of registration process for those
attending your conference. Here you can give the registrants
options such as accommodation or any specific needs. The Registration
Management comes in two parts: the Registration Form and the
Registrants.</p>
<p>These are the steps in the registration process:</p>
<p>1.  The conference manager enables the registration. To do so, go on
the <em>Registration</em> option in the left menu, and click on the button
<em>Enable</em>. He can set the registration deadline, the maximum number of
participants, to set e-mail notifications etc. (see <a class="reference internal" href="#registration-setup"><em>Setup tab</em></a>).</p>
<p>2. The registrants apply for participation. To do so, they fill in a
form that is found on the event’s page.</p>
<p><img alt="image118" src="../_images/registration.png" /></p>
<p>This form is set by the conference manager (see below). He can choose
all the options that will be available to registrants, such as social
events, accommodation etc. The conference manager will have the option
to make certain events billable (such as lunches, expeditions organized
within the conference etc.) and then to enable the e-payment. E-payment
can be enabled in the <em>Registration</em> option in the left menu, under the
tab <em>e-payment</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#epayment"><em>E-payment</em></a>).</p>
<p>3. The conference manager has access to the final list of participants,
which he can manage.</p>
<p>4. Once the list of participants has been established, Indico automatically
generates printable badges for each participants. The conference manager
can customize them by going to the tab <em>Registrants</em>, selecting registrants and then clicking
on <em>Print badges</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#registrants"><em>Registrants</em></a>, section <em>Print badges</em>), sending emails, exporting
to excel, pdf, etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="registration-form">
<h4>2.4.5.1. Registration Form<a class="headerlink" href="#registration-form" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>You can access the registration module from the option <em>Registration</em>
in the menu on the left.</p>
<p>From the Setup tab you can enable or disable the registration.
You can also modify the start/end dates of registration, the
maximum number of registrants you will take, any announcements
and if you wish to receive an email when a new registrant applies.</p>
<p><img alt="image51" src="../_images/confreg1.png" /></p>
<p>The registration form is split in <em>sections</em>. Each section is a part of
the registration form, and it contains many fields.

(see the following sections listed below). To enable or disable one of these
sections, click on the <img alt="image52" src="../_images/confreg2.png" /> image next to that section; when it is

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Settings</strong>: You can add questions you wish abstracts reviewers to answer, the number of answers per question and the scale for each answer (e.g. 1 to 10). There is also a preview of the question box on the left</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: This is where you assign reviewers to each track. Click on <em>Add Indico User</em>, a search box will appear. Search for the user(s) you wish to add, select them and click on <em>Add</em></li>
<li><strong>Notification Template</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>A notification template is an email template that the conference organizer
can pre-define and that will be automatically used by Indico under certain
circumstances (when an abstract is accepted, rejected or merged).</p>
<p>In order to create a Notification Template you have to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Go to <em>Abstracts</em> menu, click on the tab <em>Reviewing</em> and then on the option <em>notification templates</em> beneath it.</li>
<li>Click on the <em>add</em> button and fill the form as following:</li>
</ul>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Step 1:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Title: title of the notification template.</li>
<li>Description: write a description of the notification template.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Step 2:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>From address: the FROM address in the automatic email.</li>
<li>To address: who will receive the notification. You have to choose between the submitters and the primary authors, or both.</li>
<li>CC addresses: additional people who will receive the notification</li>
<li>Subject: subject of the notification</li>
<li>Body: body of the email. You can customize the body by adding special tags on it. This tags will be replaced with the information of the abstract like: title, id, URL, submitter family name, etc. Be careful to write perfectly the tags or the email will not work.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Step 3:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Choose the condition that triggers the email. This can be if it is in status ACCEPTED, REJECTED or MERGED.</li>
<li>Click on the <em>save</em> button.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the condition is ACCEPTED, you need to specify if this appplies to any contribution type and track, none, or a specific one, and then click on the button <em>submit</em>. Click on preview to preview the template.</li>
<li>If the condition is REJECTED or MERGED, or if you have done step 3, you are finished. This template will be sent under condition chosen at 2.3.1. . Therefore, Indico will automatically send the email when accepting, rejecting and merging abstracts.</li>

<h4>2.4.6.3. Abstracts<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An abstract is either submitted by an author or manually
added by a Abstract Manager (conference organizers). It is then reviewed
by the track coordinator of the track it belongs to. The track coordinator
will propose to accept, reject or merge the abstract. If it is accepted,
it will automatically become a contribution, <a class="reference external" href="#contributions-management">(see Contributions Management)</a> ,
which you can then place
in the timetable <a class="reference external" href="#timetable-management">(see Timetable Management)</a>.
Here are the different tabs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Main</strong>: From here, you can change the main information about the abstract such
as the author, co-author, contribution type etc. The Conference Manager can change
the status of an abstract, for example, by accepting it or marking it as a
duplicate.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="image36" src="../_images/confm18.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><strong>Move</strong>: Assign one or more specific contributions to a session.</li>
<li><strong>Author list</strong>:  This will show you a list of the primary authors, the co-authors and presenters.  You need to select at least one contribution before clicking on <em>Author list</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Material package</strong>: This allows you to export all the material from the contributions into a zip file[</li>
<li><strong>Proceedings</strong>: Get a zip file with all the papers and a table of contents. To generate this, the conference organiser should go through all contributions, and mark the wanted papers as main resource (click on the <img alt="image133" src="../_images/markMainResource.png" /> icon. When the star is yellow, the material is marked as main resource). Once this is done,  Indico will generate a table of contents  for all the papers and organize all PDF files by chapters into a zip file.</li>
<li><strong>PDF icon</strong>: This will create a PDF of the contributions  in the three following ways: you can export it as a contribution list (which contains more details), as a book of abstracts with less details or as a book of abstracts which is sorted by board number (useful for posters). To select a contribution you wish to export, you must first tick the corresponding box (clicking on the name will redirect you to the contribution&#8217;s page) and then on the PDF icon <img alt="image107" src="../_images/pdf.png" /> .</li>

<p>Protection in a conference is similar to that in a Category <a class="reference external" href="Categories.html#protection">(see
Protection)</a>.
There is Modification Control, Domain Control and Access Control.
When adding to the Access and Modification lists, you can also add
Groups of users if any have been defined by Administration.</p>
<p><em>Modification Control</em> Only the Managers listed in the
Modification Control, the Creator of the conference, and any
Administrators can access the Management Area of the
conference. However, you can add a Modification Key which means
anyone with this key can modify the conference without logging in.</p>
<p><em>Access Control</em> When the conference is public, anyone can view
the conference including the programme, timetable, abstracts, etc.
When the conference is private, only those in the Access List,
Conference Managers and Administrators can view the conference.
When it is inheriting, it will have the same access protection as its
parent categoy. Changing the parent&#8217;s access protection will change
the conference&#8217;s access protection accordingly; see <a class="reference internal" href="Protection.html#access-control"><em>Access Control Policy</em></a>.</p>
<p>If the conference access is  RESTRICTED the event manager will be able to set a
&#8216;Contact in case of no access&#8217;, so users with no access will know who to contact
in order to request access.</p>
<p><img alt="image49" src="../_images/confm29.png" /></p>
<p>Restricted events can have an Access Key, meaning that anyone
with this key will be able to access the conference without logging in. Users
will see a message such as the following:</p>
<p><img alt="image50" src="../_images/confm30.png" /></p>
<p>Whenever an event contains elements (sessions, contributions, ...) that have
different protection statuses (i.e. the even is private but there is a protected
element within, or conversely) a corresponding warning message will be shown.</p>
<p><img alt="image160" src="../_images/childrenProtectedPopup.png" /></p>
<p><em>Domain Control</em> This option is only for public events. It allows
to specify which domain (e.g. CERN) can access the conference.
Therefore, only users from inside this domain will be able to access.</p>
<p><em>Session coordinator&#8217;s rights</em> This informs you of the basic rights which
are always available, and allow you to modify the optional rights the session
coordinators have.</p>

<p>Clone the conference if you would like to make another conference exactly

<p>Step 1: Choose what to clone</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to choose what you wish to clone, i.e. the attached
material, the tracks, the alerts etc. To choose any of this options,
tick its corresponding box</p>
<p>Step 2: When to clone</p>
<p>You have three possibilities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cloning the event once: If you only need to clone the conference once, do Step 1 and then choose the date on which you wish to have another conference as this one, then click on <em>clone once</em>.</li>
<li>Clone the event with a fixed interval: If your event is regularly occurring, then you can choose this option. You have the choice to clone it every <em>x</em> weeks, months or years. To determine the number of times the conference will be cloned, you can choose a start and end date (e.g. every 3 weeks from 01.01.2012 to 01.08.2012) or a number of times (e.g. beginning on 01.01.2012, clone the event every 3 weeks, 10 times).</li>
<li>Clone on given days: This allows you to clone your event on given days. You will need to fix an interval (every <em>x</em> months) and give a start/end date or a start date and the number of times you wish to clone the event (e.g. beginning on 01.01.2012 , every 2 months until 01.01.2013 or beginning on 01.01.2012, every 2 months, 10 times).</li>
