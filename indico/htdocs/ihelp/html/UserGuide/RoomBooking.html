<h1>7. Conference Room Booking<a class="headerlink" href="#conference-room-booking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>7.1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter describes the Indico module for booking conference
rooms.</p>
<p>Indico users can book conference rooms for their conference and
meeting purposes. Bookings can also be standalone - they
do not have to be bound to any event. Room managers can monitor and
moderate all bookings. Indico administrators can create rooms and
manage their data.</p>
<p>Instead of being a boring manual no one ever reads, this file is
an introduction, and it assumes you have some intuition of how the web
works. The suggested way of learning is to start with a tutorial,
then play with the module on your own. Simply use the software as
any other Web page. Read context help along the way. Finally, come
back for some tips.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="the-tutorial">
<h2>7.2. The Tutorial<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can read the Core Features listings in order to get a full overview
of the options of the room booking modules. It allows you to assign
a room to a particular event, a talk or simply to book a room on its
own, without attaching it to a event. The booking can then be managed
from the administration area.</p>

<h3>7.2.1. Getting into Room Booking Module<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-into-room-booking-module" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To use Indico::CRBS directly, just click on <em>Room Booking</em> in the Indico
home page, in the top blue bar. To book rooms for your event, go to
the event management page and click on the <em>Room Booking</em> option. In both
cases you will be asked to sign in. Use your Indico login.</p>

<p>The Room Booking Module first page depends on who is logged in. For

menu option will give you the same list. Room managers will see
bookings of rooms they manage, so they can have a quick overview. If you
are a room manager, use the <em>Bookings</em> option in <em>My rooms</em> menu to
show the page again (this is only available for room manangers).</p>

<h3>7.2.6. Six Types of Booking<a class="headerlink" href="#six-types-of-booking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are six types of booking. They allow you to define
different types of recurring reservation. A common example is a weekly
meeting (which takes place at the same time every week). You can
choose from:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Single day</em>: not recurring, one-time event</li>
<li><em>Repeat daily</em>: use if you want to book many subsequent days, like
an entire week</li>
<li><em>Repeat once a week</em>: the booking will take place every week,
always on the same day</li>
<li><em>Repeat once every two weeks</em>: as above, but repeats every two
weeks</li>
<li><em>Repeat once every three weeks</em>: as above, but repeats every
three weeks</li>
<li><em>Repeat every month</em>: allows you to do bookings like &#8216;first Friday
of each month&#8217;, &#8216;second Wednesday of each month&#8217;, &#8216;fourth Saturday
of each month&#8217;, etc.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="booking-a-room">
<h3>7.2.7. Booking a Room<a class="headerlink" href="#booking-a-room" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Essentially there are two steps: selecting a room and filling in a
booking form. More detailed steps are:</p>
<p><img alt="image169" src="../_images/rb_booking_a_room.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On the Indico main page, click the <em>Room Booking</em> menu option. This is
how you access the Room Booking Module.</li>
<li>Click the <em>Book a Room</em> menu option.</li>
<li>If you know which room you want, simply select it and click
<em>Choose</em>. You will be taken directly to the booking form.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t, make use of the room searching. Specify
dates (click the calendar icon to choose the day with your mouse).
You need to select hours and booking type (single day, repeating etc.).
Also select other criteria the room must meet, such as capacity and
necessary equipment (blackboard, computer projector, etc.). Then click
the <em>Search</em> button.</li>
<li>You will be presented with a list of available rooms meeting your
criteria.</li>
<li>Choose the room you wish to book, then click on the button <em>Book</em>. You
can also view the stats of the room by clocking on the button <em>Stats</em>.
If you have the correct rights, it is possible for  you to modify the
details of the room or to delete it by clicking on <em>Modify</em> or <em>Delete</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="image170" src="../_images/rb_booking_form.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fill in a booking form. If you have searched for rooms, most fields
are already filled in for your convenience (this data comes from
the searching form). After filling in the form, click the <em>Re-check for
conflicts</em> button.</li>
<li>Scroll the page down to have a look at conflicts. Scroll more to see
the room availability calendar. Your booking is represented by a green
bar or dark red bar if it overlaps with existing bookings, which
are pink. This graphical room preview is useful especially
when doing a recurring booking. Give it a try: set the when/type
attribute to <em>Repeat once a week</em>, set the end date to be at least 2
months after the start date, and click the <em>Re-check for conflicts</em> again.
See the room calendar in its full glory.</li>
<li>If your booking conflicts with others, you have two options:<ul>
<li>In general, it is better to resolve conflicts manually: by
changing dates, hours or maybe trying another room.</li>
<li>The alternative is to automatically book everything except
conflicting days. This may be useful if you do long-term, recurring
booking, for example, <em>whole year, every week</em>. Imagine everything
looks perfect, except for several weeks when the room is not available.
In this case check the &#8216;skip conflicting dates&#8217; option to book
everything except problematic dates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <em>Book</em> button.</li>
<li>If your form is corectly filled, the system will ensure your new
booking does not conflict with others. When no conflicts are found,
you will be shown the confirmation page which lists the details of
your booking.</li>
<li>Click <em>My bookings</em> from the menu. Your new booking now appears on
the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="image171" src="../_images/rb_conflicts.png" /></p>
<p>Note: some rooms require confirmation. These rooms are usually coded
in orange. In this case, you cannot directly book them. You
can only <em>PRE-book</em> such a room. PRE-booking works exactly the same
way as booking. The only difference is that you must wait for
acceptance from the room manager.</p>
<p>Note: you can always modify your booking (or PRE-booking). It
will again be checked for conflicts.</p>
<p>Note: you can always browse your own bookings and PRE-bookings
using the menu options <em>My bookings</em> and <em>My PRE-bookings</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="view-your-booking">
<h3>7.2.8. View your Booking<a class="headerlink" href="#view-your-booking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can view the bookings or pre-bookings that you made by going
under the &#8216;My bookings&#8217; and &#8216;My PRE-bookings&#8217; sections of the Room
Booking side menu. By selecting one of the bookings in the list, you
will get the following :</p>
<p><img alt="image172" src="../_images/rb_booking_display.png" /></p>
<p>This page contains all the information about a booking, and it allows
you to modify, clone or cancel the booking. If the reservation is
done for more than a single day, each of the occurences of the booking
can be canceled individually. In addition, this page lets you watch
the history of the booking (i.e. all the past actions that were performed
on this reservation) if you are the creator of the booking. Only the most
recent entry is partially displayed, but you can see the rest of it by
clicking on the <em>Show All History...</em> link. Additional information about
a particular entry can be viewed by clicking the <em>More Info</em> link.</p>

<div class="section" id="blocking-a-room">
<h3>7.2.9. Blocking a Room<a class="headerlink" href="#blocking-a-room" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a room manager you may create room blockings which prevent regular users
from booking certain rooms. This feature can be used for special events
during which only a few people should be allowed to create bookings for
some rooms.</p>
<p>To create such a blocking, go to &#8216;Block rooms&#8217; in the Room Booking side
menu and follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Choose the period during which the rooms should be blocked by clicking the
start and end date on the calendars.</li>
<li>Enter a reason for the blocking - it will be displayed to users
trying to book one of the blocked rooms.</li>
<li>Add some rooms to the &#8216;Rooms&#8217; list. Those will be affected by the
blocking.</li>
<li>Unless you want to be the only one to be able to book the blocked
rooms, you can add other users or groupe to the &#8220;Allowed users/groups&#8221;
list.</li>
<li>Submit the blocking after confirming that the chosen period is correct.
Once you have created the blocking, the dates cannot be changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>When trying to book a blocked room, users in the &#8216;Allowed users/groups&#8217;
list will see that the room is blocked and the reason why but will be able
to create bookings anyway. You as the creator of the blocking will always
be able to override your blocking, so you don&#8217;t have to add yourself to
the list. The same applies to the owners of blocked rooms. They will see
the blocking and a warning that the room has been blocked, but they are
able to override the blocking.</p>
<p>You can also create blockings for rooms you don&#8217;t own. These blockings
will have to be approved be the respective owners - until they do so,
other users trying to create a booking on that room will see the pending
blocking request but will be able to carry on with their booking.</p>
<p>As soon as the blocking for a room has been approved (blockings for your own
rooms are immediately approved when creating the blocking), all bookings
colliding with the blocking are automatically rejected.</p>

<p>This section describes core capabilities and constraints of the Room

<p>Note that the Room Booking Module is NOT supposed to be a general-purpose
&#8220;room management&#8221; or &#8220;room booking&#8221; software.</p>
<p>It was built with conference rooms in mind. Its main purpose
is to make conference organization easier. We see room booking as a
part of conference organization (but it is possible to book rooms
without associating the booking to an event).</p>

(the bookings will not be assigned to any Indico event).</li>
<li>The &#8220;In-conference&#8221; mode allows you to book rooms for your event. You
can assign booked rooms to conferences, lectures, meetings, sessions,
contributions or breaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recurring bookings (&#8216;every day&#8217;, &#8216;every week&#8217;, &#8216;every 3rd Wednesday
of a month&#8217;, etc).</li>
<li>E-mail notifications (to users and room managers, about every
important action).</li>
<li>Three user roles: (1) Indico administrator, (2) room manager and
(3) ordinary user.</li>
<li>Optional booking moderation. Each room may work in one of the
following modes:<ul>

creating an Indico account shared by several people).</p>
<p>The room must have a defined building, which must be a number.
This is mandatory. If you do not need building, put any number there
(like &#8216;0&#8217;). If your building naming scheme has letters, we are

<p><em>Room</em>: meeting or conference room. Please note that the software is
not suitable for managing other rooms, like offices, corridors, etc.</p>
<p><em>Location</em>: physical location of rooms. Room custom attributes
and possible equipment are defined on a location basis. Example:
rooms at CERN may have different attributes and different equipment
than rooms in Fermilab.</p>
<p><em>Booking</em>: final reservation of a room. While considered final,
it still may be rejected in case of emergency.</p>
<p><em>PRE-booking</em>: unconfirmed reservation of a room. PRE-booking
is subject to acceptance or rejection.</p>
<p><em>Room responsible/manager</em>: the person who accepts/rejects bookings.
Each room has exactly one person responsible. A person may be
responsible for any number of rooms.</p>
<p><em>Room blocking</em>: a restriction created by a room manager which prevents
users from booking the rooms listed in the blocking unless they have
explicit permission to override the permission or own the rooms.</p>
