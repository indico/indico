<h1>1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the Video Services User Guide for the Video Services
Administrator.</p>
<p>You have been appointed as a Video Services Administrator in order
to overview one or all of the Video Services Systems in all of
Indico. Or, you are an Indico Server Administrator that wants to overview
the Video Services Systems.</p>
<p>In Indico&#8217;s Menu Bar, you should see a Video Services Overview
button:</p>
<p><img alt="image01" src="../../_images/index_html_7339cfff.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. Video Services Overview button</p>
<p>Or, a Video Services Overview menu entry in your Administration
menu (if you are also an Indico administrator):</p>
<p><img alt="image02" src="../../_images/index_html_10323a5a1.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 2. Administration menu</p>
<p>Click on it to access the Video Services Overview page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-video-services-overview-page">
<h1>2. The Video Services Overview page<a class="headerlink" href="#the-video-services-overview-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Video Services Overview page lets you query the index of all
bookings / requests that have been performed on any of the Video
Services Systems.</p>
<p>This page is divided into two main parts: the top part that you can
interact with to get query results, and a bottom part where you get
the results.</p>
<p>The top part is in turn divided into three sections: a list of
indexes, a <em>filtering</em> section, and a <em>View By</em> section.</p>
<p><img alt="image03" src="../../_images/fig31.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 3. Video Services Overview page.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-different-indexes">
<h2>2.1. The different indexes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-different-indexes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the top, you can select one of the indexes (<strong>zone 1</strong> in figure
3). There are three types of index:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“All” index: here you find all the bookings or requests of the
Indico system, regardless of what system / plug-in is being used.</li>
<li>Individual plug-in indexes: one for each plug-in. In the screenshot above,
these are the CERNMCU, EVO, RecordingRequest, Vidyo and WebcastRequest indexes.</li>
<li>“Combined” indexes: some plug-ins may want to appear into an
additional index, with other plug-ins. In the screenshot above, you
will see the “All Videoconference” index, which groups CERNMCU bookings,
EVO bookings and Vidyo bookings.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hover the mouse over the name of an index, it will show what
kind of bookings are included in it.</p>
<p>Click on one of the index names to get results from that index.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-filtering-section">
<h2>2.2. The filtering section<a class="headerlink" href="#the-filtering-section" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Under the index names, there is a section used to <strong>filter</strong> the
results (<strong>zone 2</strong> in figure 3).</p>
<div class="section" id="restrict-to-pending-requests-only">
<h3>2.2.1. Restrict to pending requests only<a class="headerlink" href="#restrict-to-pending-requests-only" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some plug-ins can have a “pending” state. In particular,
<em>Recording Request</em> and <em>Webcast Request</em> have the concept of
“pending” requests, which means requests that have been submitted
to our responsibles, but have not yet been accepted or rejected.</p>
<p>Checking the <em>Show only pending</em> option will filter the results so
that only pending requests are shown.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restrict-by-category-id">
<h3>2.2.2. Restrict by category id<a class="headerlink" href="#restrict-by-category-id" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Enter a category ID here to restrict the view to only bookings and
requests associated with the category&#8217;s events.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restrict-by-conference-id">
<h3>2.2.3. Restrict by conference id<a class="headerlink" href="#restrict-by-conference-id" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Enter an event (meeting / lecture / conference) ID here to restrict
the view to only bookings and requests associated this event.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results-per-page">
<h3>2.2.4. Results per page<a class="headerlink" href="#results-per-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If there are many results, they will be paginated, as shown in the
screenshot. You can change the amount of results per page. Bookings
are usually grouped (per date or per event, depending on the type
of view). This number will change the number of <em>groups</em> that
appear in each page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restrict-results-to-an-interval">
<h3>2.2.5. Restrict results to an interval<a class="headerlink" href="#restrict-results-to-an-interval" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="filtering-by-event-title">
<h4>2.2.5.1. Filtering by event title<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-by-event-title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you have selected <em>View By: Event title</em> in the <em>View By</em> section,
then you can filter by event title. The filtering section looks
like this:</p>
<p><img alt="image04" src="../../_images/index_html_m7d810dd9.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 4. Filtering section, when <em>View By: Event Title</em> is
selected</p>
<p>You can write text in the <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> boxes to bind results
based on the event title. For example, if you enter “ATLAS” in the
<em>from</em> box, and “CHEP” in the <em>to</em> box, you will get all the
bookings and requests which are in events whose title is between
“ATLAS” and “CHEP” in alphabetical order. For example, you would
get bookings from an event called “Bosons are Wonderful”, but not
those belonging to an event called “Delta Gamma Phi”.</p>
<p>If you leave the <em>from</em> box empty, there will be no boundary for
the results on the “initial” side; if you leave the <em>to</em> box empty,
there will be no boundary for the results on the “ending” side. So,
for example, writing “ATLAS” in the <em>from</em> box and nothing in the
<em>to</em> box will return all the bookings and requests for events whose
title lies alphabetically after “ATLAS”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filtering-by-dates">
<h4>2.2.5.2. Filtering by dates<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-by-dates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you have selected
<em>View By: Event Start Date,</em> or <em>View By: Creation Date,*or*View By: Modification Date,*or*View By: Start Date</em>
in the <em>View By</em> section, you can filter by date. The filtering
section looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="image05" src="../../_images/index_html_136982eb.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 5. Filtering section, when <em>View By: Event Start Date, Creation Date, Modification Date,</em>
or <em>Start Date</em> are selected</p>
<p>There are two choices for filtering by date:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Filter between two dates. Enter the dates in the <em>Since</em> and <em>to</em>
boxes. When you click on the boxes, a calendar should appear to
help you input the date.</p>
<p>If you do not enter anything in one box, you will not restrict the
bookings in that direction. For example, if you only put 01/08/2009
in the <em>Since</em> box, you will get all the bookings <em>after</em> the
01/08/2009.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Filter between two dates relative to the present. Enter an
<em>amount of days</em> in the <em>from *** days ago</em> and
<em>to *** days in the future</em> boxes.</p>
<p>For example, to see all the bookings and requests of the next two
weeks, I would enter 0 in the <em>From *** days ago</em> box, and 14 in
the <em>to *** days in the future</em> box.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, if what you enter is not in the correct format
(dates in the first case, integers in the second case) the related
fields will be highlighted in red.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refresh-apply-filter-button">
<h3>2.2.6. Refresh / Apply Filter button<a class="headerlink" href="#refresh-apply-filter-button" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every time that a value of one of the filtering fields is changed,
the results do not update automatically. You need to press the
<em>Apply Filter</em> button for the changes to take place.</p>
<p>If you want to update the results without changing the filtering
criteria, press the same button (its text should read <em>Refresh</em>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-view-by-section">
<h2>2.3. The View By section<a class="headerlink" href="#the-view-by-section" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Under the <em>filtering</em> section appears the <em>View By</em> section
(<strong>zone 3</strong> in figure 3).</p>

<h3>2.3.1. Choose how to view the results<a class="headerlink" href="#choose-how-to-view-the-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here you can choose if you want to view your results ordered by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Event title: the results will be grouped by the event they belong
to, and will be ordered by the name of that event, alphabetically.</li>
<li>Event start date: the results will be grouped by the event they
belong to, and will be ordered by the start date of that event.</li>
<li>Creation date: the results will be ordered by the date they were
created. They will also be grouped by day (taking into account your
personal timezone). For bookings, this means the moment that they
were created with the “Create” button. For requests, this means the
moment the request was initially sent.</li>
<li>Modification date: the results will be ordered by the last time
they were modified. They will also be grouped by day (taking into
account your personal timezone). For bookings, this is the last
time a booking was edited. For requests, this is the last time the
request was modified.</li>
<li>Start date: the results will be order by their start time. They
will also be grouped by day (taking into account your personal
timezone). Some bookings or requests may not have a “start date”.
For now, only EVO and CERNMCU bookings have a start date;
<em>Recording Request</em> and <em>Webcast Request</em> do not.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choose-how-to-order-the-results">
<h3>2.3.2. Choose how to order the results<a class="headerlink" href="#choose-how-to-order-the-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the right, you can choose the order of the results:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Descending<ul>
<li>For the <em>view by event title</em> option, the results will be shown in
alphabetical order.</li>
<li>For the other date-related <em>view by</em> options, they will be shown in
chronological order, the most recent dates first and the oldest
dates later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ascending<ul>
<li>For the <em>view by event title</em> option, the results will be shown in
reverse alphabetical order.</li>
<li>For the other date-related <em>view by</em> options, they will be shown in
reverse chronological order, the oldest dates first and the most
recent dates later.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="kinds-of-bookings-requests-shown">
<h3>2.3.3. Kinds of bookings / requests shown<a class="headerlink" href="#kinds-of-bookings-requests-shown" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second line of this section informs you which kind of bookings
are displayed depending on your <em>View By</em> option. This is relevant,
in the case of <em>View By Start Date</em>, because requests
(RecordingRequest, WebcastRequest) do not have a start date.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="static-url-for-the-result">
<h3>2.3.4. Static URL for the result<a class="headerlink" href="#static-url-for-the-result" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This option will prove very useful if you often perform similar
queries.</p>
<p>Click on <em>Static URL for this result</em> and a new line will appear:</p>
<p><img alt="image07" src="../../_images/index_html_m38e22d3d.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 7. Static URL for a result and Go to URL link.</p>
<p>You can copy the URL in the text box or bookmark it. The parameters
of your query, such as which index is being queried, are encoded in
the URL and so you will not need to enter them again.</p>
<p>You can also click on <em>Go to URL</em> to test the URL directly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-results-section">
<h2>2.4. The results section<a class="headerlink" href="#the-results-section" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the bottom half of the page, you will be able to see the results
of your query (<strong>zone 4</strong> in figure 3).</p>
<p>In case there are no results, <em>No results found</em> will appear.</p>
<p>If there are results, from top to bottom you will see the following
results:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Number of bookings or requests returned. e.g.
<em>Query returned 867 results</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Number of bookings or requests in the index. e.g.
<em>1546 bookings in this index</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The results themselves. As mentioned previously, they will be
grouped either by event, or by day, depending on what you chose
in the <em>View By</em> section.</p>
<p>Depending on the <em>Results per page</em> parameter, your results may be
paginated. Results with lots of bookings will probably be
paginated. Click a page number to change the page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the results is a row with several columns.</p>
<p>If the results are grouped by event (<em>View by Event Title</em> and
<em>View by Event Start Date</em>), the columns will be, from left to
right:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Type of booking or request (EVO, RecordingRequest, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Status message (Ready to start, Accepted, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Last modification date.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A short info text written by each plug-in (e.g., the title of the
booking).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A <em>Change</em> link that takes you to the Video Services section of the
associated event, in order to change the booking or request, or see
more of its data.</p>
<p>As a Video Services Administrator, you have the right to perform
any operation in the Video Services Section.</p>
<p>This link is especially useful for Video Service Administrators of
<em>Recording Request</em> and <em>Webcast Request.</em> They can click on it in
order to go to a request page and <em>Accept*or *Reject</em> it. The
<em>Accept</em> and <em>Reject</em> buttons will appear at the top of the request
page.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An <em>Event Display</em> link that shows the event display page of the
event with which the booking is associated. For meetings and lectures, this
will be the display page of the event. For conferences, it will be
the Video Services display page of the conference.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the results are grouped by date
(<em>View by Creation Date, View by Modification Date*and
*View by Start Date</em>), the columns will be, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Start time, in your own display timezone. e.g. 16:05.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Type of booking or request (EVO, RecordingRequest, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Status message (Ready to start, Accepted, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Title of the event the booking or request belongs to.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A short info text written by each plug-in (e.g., the title of the
booking).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A <em>Change</em> link that lets you go to the Video Services Section of
the associated event, in order to change the booking or request, or
see more of its data.</p>
<p>As a Video Services Administrator, you have the right to perform
any operation in the Video Services Section.</p>
