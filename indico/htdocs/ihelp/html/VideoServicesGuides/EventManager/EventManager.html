<h1>3.1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Indico now allows event managers to book and program
remote collaboration sessions (videoconferences, webcasts, etc.) and recording requests associated with their events. For example, EVO, the CERN MCU service, or Vidyo systems can be used. Other Indico users can see information about these videoconferences in the public pages of the events.</p>
<p>Event managers can now also perform service requests by filling out
forms that now appear inside Indico&#8217;s event management interface.
Examples of such requests are the <em>Recording Request</em> and the
<em>Webcast Request</em>.</p>
<p>Three different kinds of Indico users can make use of this
functionality:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The creator of an event.</li>
<li>An event manager appointed by the creator of the event (or another
manager).</li>
<li>A Video Services manager, appointed by the event creator or one of
the event managers. These users have privileges to access the
<em>Video Services</em> section but cannot access any other section in
the event management interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>After an event is created, the management interface of an Indico
event is similar to figure 1:</p>
<p><img alt="figure01" src="../../_images/html_66602418.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. Management interface for an Indico event, currently in
the <em>General Settings</em> section.
The <em>Video Services</em> section is highlighted in orange.</p>
<p>Your event should have a <em>Video Services</em> section (marked in
orange), unless the Indico administrators have deactivated all the Video Services systems for your kind of event (Lecture, Meeting, or Conference) or for all kinds of event.</p>
<p>For more information on the EVO and CERN&#8217;s MCU services, please

<p>Click on the <em>Video Services</em> link to access the <em>Video Services</em>
section.</p>
<p><em>Note</em> : the page that will be loaded now will possibly be HTTPs
(the URL in the browser should start by <a class="reference external" href="https://">https://</a> ... ).</p>
<p>In the <em>Video Services</em> section, you will see something similar to

<p>Figure 2. <em>Video Services</em> section for an event. The
<em>Videoconferencing</em> tab is selected.</p>
<p>You should see several tabs. Only tabs corresponding to systems
enabled for your kind of event (Lecture, Meeting, Conference) will appear. In the above image, the tabs are <em>Videoconferencing</em>, <em>Recording</em> <em>Request</em> , <em>Webcast</em> <em>Request</em> and <em>Managers</em> .</p>
<p>The <em>Managers</em> tab is always present and lets you appoint other
people so that they have rights to manage part of, or all of, the
<em>Video Services</em> section. We will talk about the <em>Managers</em> tab
later.</p>
<p>The other tabs group the different Video Services systems. At the time this guide was written, there are five such systems: EVO, CERNMCU and Vidyo (all of them Video Conference systems grouped under the <em>Videoconferencing</em> tab), Recording Request and Webcast Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="video-services-system-types">
<h1>3.3. Video Services system types<a class="headerlink" href="#video-services-system-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are two types of system: <em>booking</em> systems and <em>request</em>
systems.</p>
<p><em>Booking</em> systems let you book resources in videoconferencing
systems, such as virtual meeting room in EVO (Enabling Virtual Organizations) or a videoconference in CERN&#8217;s MCU.</p>
<p><em>Request</em> systems let you request services for your event, such as
requesting that your event be recorded ( <em>Recording Request)</em> or
webcasted ( <em>Webcast Request)</em> .</p>
<div class="section" id="booking-systems">
<h2>3.3.1. Booking systems<a class="headerlink" href="#booking-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>EVO, CERNMCU and Vidyo are <em>booking</em> systems. They let you make a videoconference booking in EVO, Vidyo or CERN&#8217;s MCU associated with your event. You can make more than one booking of each type for your Indico Event.</p>
<p>This chapter of the guide discusses common functions of these
systems. For more details about how to manage booking for the EVO
system in particular, see chapter <a class="reference external" href="#the-evo-system">EVO system</a>.
For more details about CERNMCU bookings, please see chapter <a class="reference external" href="#the-cernmcu-system">CERNMCU system</a>
For more details about how to manage booking for the Vidyo system see chapter <a class="reference external" href="#the-vidyo-system">Vidyo system</a></p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-booking">
<h3>3.3.1.1. Creating a booking<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-booking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To create a booking, select a system (EVO, CERNMCU or Vidyo) and click
<em>Create</em> .</p>
<p><img alt="figure03" src="../../_images/fig3.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 3. Creating an EVO booking.</p>
<p>A pop-up dialogue will appear, asking you for data. This pop-up has two tabs: <em>Basic</em> and <em>Advanced</em> . The <em>Basic</em> tab contains the basic, important data that you need to fill in in order to make a
booking.</p>
<p><img alt="figure04" src="../../_images/html_m1ce614f6.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 4. Dialogue to create an EVO booking. Basic tab.</p>

<p>Figure 5. Advanced tab to create a booking.</p>
<p>After you have filled in the fields, press the <em>Save</em> button. If
there is a mistake with any of the fields, they will be highlighted in red. For example, in figure 6 below, there are two problems: the description is empty and the end date of the booking is before the start date (which is unreasonable).</p>
<p><img alt="figure06" src="../../_images/html_623f82ba.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 6. While creating a booking, some fields were highlighted in

<div class="section" id="list-of-bookings">
<h3>3.3.1.2. List of bookings<a class="headerlink" href="#list-of-bookings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After you have created the booking, it will appear under
<em>Current Bookings</em> . In figure 7 below, two bookings have already
been created. As you can see, the most recently created or
modified booking is highlighted in yellow for some seconds.</p>
<p><img alt="figure07" src="../../_images/html_2c7ef69.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 7. List of already created bookings.</p>
<p>When bookings have been created, they are organized as rows of a
table / list.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The <em>Type</em> column specifies the type of booking (EVO, CERNMCU or Vidyo).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>Status</em> column specifies the current status of the booking. If
you want to reload or update the status, press the <img alt="image0" src="../../_images/html_4108b437.png" /> button
(<em>reload)</em> . This will query the remote system (EVO, CERNMCU or Vidyo) to
see if there have been any changes. For example, maybe it is
already time to start the booking; or maybe an administrator of EVO,
CERNMCU or Vidyo has deleted your booking for some reason.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>Info</em> column gives a short summary of relevant information
about this booking. This depends on the kind of booking involved.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Between <em>Info</em> and <em>Actions,</em> you will find the <img alt="image1" src="../../_images/html_m7f295075.png" /> button
(<em>edit</em> ) and the <img alt="image2" src="../../_images/html_25c4d730.png" /> button (<em>delete</em> ).</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">If you press the edit button, the same pop-up dialogue as when you
created the booking will appear, and you will be able to modify the
data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you press the delete button, after a confirmation warning, you
will be able to delete the booking (both from Indico and from the
remote system transparently).</p>
<p><img alt="figure08" src="../../_images/html_5abfb4ff.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 8. Confirmation dialogue for removing a booking .</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It is possible that the delete button is disabled: <img alt="image3" src="../../_images/html_m1976455e.png" />. This
means you cannot delete the booking at the moment. For example, the
EVO system does not allow you to delete bookings which have already taken
place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In the <em>Actions</em> column, you can trigger some commands related to
your booking. Currently the two commands available are: <img alt="image4" src="../../_images/html_5dda0430.png" />
(<em>Start</em> ) and <img alt="image5" src="../../_images/html_m54e346b.png" /> (<em>Stop</em> ).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you press the <em>Start</em> button, the videoconference will start.</li>
<li>The Stop button will stop it.</li>
<li>If they are disabled (greyed out), you cannot perform this action
at the moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Please notice the <img alt="image6" src="../../_images/html_m640d2242.png" /> button on the left of each row. If you
press it, you will get detailed information about the booking.</p>

<h2>3.3.2. Request systems<a class="headerlink" href="#request-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Recording Request</em> and <em>Webcast Request</em> are <em>request</em> systems.</p>
<p>Instead of performing a booking in a videoconference system, such
as EVO, CERN&#8217;s MCU or Vidyo, these parts of the Video Services section are
useful to request a service for your event.</p>
<p>You can only perform one request of each type for your Indico
Event, although you can change its details after you send it.</p>
<p>Click on the <em>Recording Request</em> or <em>Webcast Request</em> tabs to
request these services. You will have to fill in a form for this
request.</p>
<p>By filling in these forms, you are requesting a CERN Recording
expert to come and record your event, or a CERN Webcast expert to
webcast your event.</p>
<p>These forms are very detailed and their purpose is to facilitate
the communication between you and the Recording or Webcast services.
Please take some time to fill them in correctly as that will save both
you and the services&#8217; responsibles valuable time.</p>
<p>We will discuss the details of the <em>Recording Request</em> form and the
<em>Webcast Request</em> form later, in chapters
<a class="reference external" href="#the-recording-request-system">Recording Request system</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="#the-webcast-request-system">Webcast Request system</a> The parts common
to both forms are found at their top and bottom: they are the
buttons to send, modify or withdraw the request.</p>
<p><img alt="image7" src="../../_images/html_m61d8945b.png" /> <img alt="image8" src="../../_images/html_541e9ff0.png" /></p>
<p>Figures 12 and 13 . Buttons to send / modify / withdraw a request.</p>
<p>Once the request has been submitted, a line will appear at the top
with the current status of the request, as shown in figure 14
below.</p>
<p><img alt="figure14" src="../../_images/html_m4a6d2db3.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 14. Status of a request.</p>
<p>The initial status will be <em>Request successfully sent</em> . This means
that an email has been sent to the corresponding responsible person
with all the details that you input in the form. After the service
responsible has decided if he accepts your request or not, he will
either accept or reject the request.</p>
<p>If the request is accepted, the status will look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="figure15" src="../../_images/html_m5dc464a0.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 15. <em>Request accepted</em> status .</p>
<p>If the request has been rejected, the status will look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="figure16" src="../../_images/html_32473d75.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 16. <em>Request rejected</em> status, showing the rejection
reason.</p>
<p>You can see that in this case the responsible has also given you a
reason for his rejection.</p>
<p>In both cases (accept and reject), the following people will
receive an email as notification:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The creator of the event.</li>
<li>Any managers of the event.</li>
<li>Any Video Services Managers (be it of all systems, or only of the
corresponding one).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also come back to the page to see the status, or if you do
not want to reload the page, use the <img alt="image9" src="../../_images/html_4108b437.png" /> button to reload
(update) the status.</p>
<p>Even after a request is accepted or rejected, you can still modify
it, which will trigger another email to be sent to the responsible
person.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-managers-tab">
<h2>3.3.3. The Managers tab<a class="headerlink" href="#the-managers-tab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Managers</em> tab lets you appoint other people to have rights to
access and use the Video Services section, even if these people are
not Event Managers themselves.</p>
<p>There are two types of Managers: <em>Video Services Managers</em> and
<em>Individual System Managers</em> .</p>
<p><img alt="figure17" src="../../_images/html_m34ab3da5.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 17. <em>Managers</em> tab inside the <em>Video Services</em> section.</p>
<p>People added as <em>Video Services Managers</em> will be able to access
all the tabs of the Video Services section (Collaboration,
Recording Request, etc., and the Managers tab too) and perform any
operation that you can perform there.</p>
<p>In order to add someone, you can either click on <em>Add Indico User</em>
which will bring a standard user search pop-up dialogue, or click
<em>Add from favourites</em> which will bring up your favourite
users.</p>
<p><img alt="figure18" src="../../_images/html_45f0f553.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 18. Adding a manager. We can add an existing user by
searching or by selecting one of our favourite ones.</p>
<p>Remember you can always change your favourite users by clicking on
your name at the top right corner and then going to <em>Favorites</em> .</p>
<p><img alt="figure19" src="../../_images/html_6b114cee.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 19. Indico status bar. The user name is highlighted in
orange.
Click on it to go to your profile and then click on <em>Favorites</em> to
add or remove favourite users.</p>
<p>People added as a Manager for an individual system will see only
one of the tabs (the corresponding one for that system) and will be
able to manipulate only bookings or requests of that system.</p>
<p>As shown in figure 20 below, you can see how someone who is a Video
Services Manager views the management interface of an event:</p>
<p><img alt="figure20" src="../../_images/html_m719ed08e.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 20. View of the management interface by a manager. Only the
<em>Video Services</em> section is available.</p>
<p>And here how someone who is only a CERNMCU Manager views it:</p>
<p><img alt="figure21" src="../../_images/html_4d7f2740.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 21. View of the management interface by a CERNMCU manager.
Only the <em>Videconferencing</em> tab is available.</p>
<p>As you can see, even if the CERNMCU Manager can see the
Collaboration tab, he or she cannot see or create bookings of other
systems (EVO or Vidyo), unless of course he is also a manager of that other
system.</p>
<p>People added in the <em>Managers</em> tab can access the <em>Video Services</em>
section of an event by clicking on the <img alt="image10" src="../../_images/html_m6d76c2a0.png" /> icon
(<em>Modify Event</em> ).</p>
<p>In summary, you should add someone as Video Services Manager if you
want to give that person great control over the Video Services
section, including appointing other Video Service Managers; and add
people as individual system managers if you want to keep control
over what they can do.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://evo.caltech.edu/evoGate/index.jsp">EVO</a> is a
videoconferencing system provided by Caltech, where you can book a virtual room (an <em>EVO meeting).</em> Users can join this virtual room and have a videoconferencing session together, send video, talk, chat and share slides. To use EVO, you will need a PC
equipped with a webcam or an H.323 device (tipically a Tandberg or Polycom. You will also need to
<a class="reference external" href="http://evo.caltech.edu/evoGate/index.jsp">create an account</a> in
EVO (click on <em>Register</em> ). For more information, see

<p>The details given are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Meeting title, Community, Start date, End date, Meeting description, Access password, Hidden</em>
: these are the fields that you have input in the creation dialogue.</li>
<li><em>Auto-join URL</em> : this is the URL that you can give to other people
so that they can join the meeting. Just paste it into a browser and
the EVO client will be launched. After authentication, the client
will automatically join the meeting, prompting the user for a
password if an access password was set up.</li>
<li><em>Indico booking ID</em> : this is an ID assigned by Indico to this
booking. Use it if you have any problem and you need to contact
Indico support.</li>
<li><em>Booking created on</em> : this shows when the booking was created.</li>
<li><em>Booking last modified on</em> : this shows the last time that the
booking information was modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, in case of problems, there will be information in red in the

<h3>3.4.1.3. Problems when creating or modifying a booking<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-when-creating-or-modifying-a-booking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the booking creation and modification dialogue, it is possible
that when you try to save your booking, some of the fields are
highlighted in red.</p>
<p><img alt="figure28" src="../../_images/html_623f82ba.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 28. In the <em>EVO booking creation</em> dialogue, some fields were
highlighted in red in order to point out mistakes.</p>
<p>Situations where this can happen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>You left the meeting title empty</em> . The <em>title</em> field will be
highlighted in red.</li>
<li><em>You left the meeting description empty</em> . The <em>description</em> field
will be highlighted in red.</li>
<li><em>The start time is too soon</em> . The <em>start time</em> field will be
highlighted in red, and if you hover the mouse over it the reason
for the problem will be shown. This can happen for two reasons:<ul>
<li><em>The start time is under the limit of your Indico Event start time</em>
(currently the limit is 60 min before the Indico Event start time)</li>
<li><em>The start time is in the past</em> . For example, if your clock shows
that it&#8217;s 4pm, you will not be able to create a meeting that starts
at 3pm of the same day (or a previous day). The allowed margin is
30 min (so 3.30pm would be allowed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>The ending time is too late</em> . The <em>ending time</em> field will be
highlighted in red. The ending time cannot be more than 60 min
after the ending time of the Indico event.</li>
<li><em>The ending time is in the past</em> . The <em>ending time</em> field will be
highlighted in red.</li>
<li><em>The ending time is before the start time</em> . Both fields will be
highlighted in red.</li>
<li>EVO considers the booking as duplicated. This happens if your
booking has the same title and very similar (around 5 min) start
and end times as a pre-existing booking. In this case, you will get
a warning dialogue and the <em>title</em>, <em>start time</em> and <em>end time</em> fields will
be highlighted in red. Try to change either the title or the times
to get rid of this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems when you come to the Collaboration tab or when you
update the status:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>The booking has been deleted by EVO</em> . It is possible that the
administrators of the EVO system have deleted your booking for some
reason. Indico checks this and informs you if it is the case. This
occurrence should be very rare.</li>
<li><em>The booking&#8217;s data has been changed by EVO</em> . It is possible that
the administrators of the EVO system have modified your booking for
some reason (maybe the title was inappropriate, or a similar
reason). Indico checks for this and informs you if it is the case,
listing the changed fields.</li>

<h2>3.4.2. The CERNMCU system<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cernmcu-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CERNMCU system is based on a Codian MCU (similarly to EsNet service) and lets you book videoconferences in CERN&#8217;s MCU (Multipoint Control Unit).
This allows you to enjoy multi-point videoconferences between rooms
and people equipped with an H.323 device. Indico will allow you to
pre-define a list of remote participants (typically, CERN rooms).</p>
<p>Videoconferences booked in this way through Indico can be started
and stopped through Indico as well. Indico will tell CERN&#8217;s MCU to
connect all the pre-defined remote participants and start a
videoconference. However, other persons or rooms can join the
videoconference by following the instructions generated with each
boking.</p>
<p>The CERNMCU system is under the <em>Videoconferencing</em> tab.</p>

<p>In the <em>Basic</em> tab, you should fill in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Name</em> : the name of your videoconference. Two simultaneously scheduled
conferences cannot exist in the MCU with the same name. Indico
automatically fills in this field with the name of your Indico
event, but you can change it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Description</em> : a description of your MCU conference. Indico
automatically fills in this field with the description from your
Indico event, but you can change it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>ID</em> : a unique 5-digit number that identifies your conference
inside the MCU. It will also be needed by people who want to join
the videoconference even if they were not added to the list of
<em>Remote Participants</em> .</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you choose the <em>Let Indico choose</em> option, Indico will choose a

statuses are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Booking created</em> : you just created or modified a CERNMCU booking,
and you cannot start it yet.</li>
<li><em>Ready to start!</em> : you can already start the videoconference that
you booked. The button <img alt="image7" src="../../_images/html_m61d8945b.png" /> should be enabled. Press it to
start the videoconference.</li>
<li><em>Conference started!</em> : you pressed the <img alt="image8" src="../../_images/html_541e9ff0.png" /> button and the
videoconference has started successfully. You should see the other
participants on the screen of your room and the other participants
should see you.</li>
<li><em>Conference stopped</em> : you pressed the <img alt="image9" src="../../_images/html_4108b437.png" /> (<em>Stop</em> ) button
and the videoconference has been stopped successfully. You should
not see the other participants on your room&#8217;s screen.</li>

<p>In the booking creation / modification dialogue, it is possible that
when you try to save your booking, some of the fields are
highlighted in red.</p>
<p><img alt="figure49" src="../../_images/html_21b4d6d8.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 49. Some mistakes were made while creating or modifying a
CERNMCU booking.
The corresponding fields have been highlighted in red.</p>
<p>Situations where this can happen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>You left the videoconference Name empty</em> . The <em>Name</em> field will be
highlighted in red.</li>
<li><em>You left the videoconference description empty</em> . The <em>Description</em>
field will be highlighted in red.</li>
<li>You selected <em>Choose one manually</em> in the ID field, and you did not
fill in the field with the ID of your liking, or the ID is not a
5-digit number. That field will be highlighted in red and if you
hover the mouse over it the reason for the problem will be shown.</li>
<li><em>The start time is too soon</em> . The <em>Start Time</em> field will be
highlighted in red. This can happen for two reasons:<ul>
<li><em>The start time is under the limit</em> of your Indico Event start time
(currently the limit is 60 min before the Indico Event start time)</li>
<li><em>The start time is in the past</em> . For example, if your clock shows
that it&#8217;s 4pm, you will not be able to create a meeting that starts
at 3pm of the same day (or a previous day). The allowed margin is
30 min (so 3.30pm would be allowed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>The ending time is in the past</em> . The <em>Ending Time</em> field will be
highlighted in red.</li>
<li><em>The ending time is too late.</em> The <em>Ending Time</em> field will be
highlighted in red. The ending time cannot be later than the Indico
Event end time.</li>
<li><em>The ending time is before the start time</em> . Both fields will be
highlighted in red.</li>
<li><em>Conference name already exists in the MCU</em> . The <em>Name</em> field will
be highlighted in red. You have to choose a new conference Name for
this problem to disappear.</li>
<li><em>You chose a MCU ID yourself and that ID already exists in the MCU</em>.
The custom ID text field will be highlighted in red. You have to
choose another ID or let Indico choose one automatically for this
problem to disappear.</li>
<li>Other problems that might occur, but rarely:<ul>
<li>The MCU considers that one of your participants is duplicated (for
example, if two ongoing videoconferences attempt to add the
participant at the same time). You will get an error pop-up with an
explanatory message.</li>
<li>The MCU cannot accept any more videoconferences because its
capacity is full. You will get an error pop-up with an explanatory
message.</li>
<li>The MCU cannot accept any more participants because its capacity is
full. You will get an error pop-up with an explanatory message.</li>
<li>You let Indico choose an ID automatically but Indico was not able
to find a free ID in the MCU. You will get an error pop-up with an
explanatory message.</li>
<li>Other errors: you will get an error pop-up with an error code.</li>
<li>For all these errors, you should probably contact Indico support.</li>

<p>Vidyo videoconferencing system is a pioneer in a new era of videoconferencing products that deliver HD quality over the Internet. The system leverages the new H.264 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) standard, results in the industry&#8217;s best resilience and lowest latency to be accomplished over converged IP networks. Vidyo can be used from a variety of platforms ranging from Mac &amp; Windows desktops to dedicated H.323 devices and phone accesses.</p>

<p>To create a Vidyo booking, select <em>Vidyo</em> in the list of systems and
then click on <em>Create</em>. Vidyo has a different concept than EVO. In EVO you need to make a booking everytime you need a videoconference for a given event. In Vidyo, the booking needs to be done only once, provided that this room is used regularly. If the room is not used anymore, the system will automatic cleanup the room.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Room name</em> : this is the name the room in Vidyo will have</li>
<li><em>Description</em> : this is the description of room</li>
<li><em>Event linking</em> : one can link a vidyo booking to the event (default), a session or a contribution. The event can be linked to several vidyo rooms, however the sessions and contributions can be linked only to one vidyo room</li>
<li><em>Moderator</em> : The moderator will be the room responsible and will own the rights to moderate the vidyo room</li>
<li><em>Moderator PIN</em> : this is the code to grant moderator rights</li>
<li><em>Meeting PIN</em> : this is the code to protect the room</li>
<li><em>Automute</em> : enabling automute forces that the VidyoDesktop clients will join the meeting muted by default (audio and video)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <em>Advanced tab</em>, there are three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Display the Public room&#8217;s PIN</em> : if one wants the PIN to be published on the event page, one should tick this option</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Display auto-join URL in event page</em> : this is the URL that you can give to other people so that they can join the meeting.

<p>Once the request is sent, the Recording Responsible will either

<p>Figure 66. <em>Request rejected</em> status. The rejection reason is
shown.</p>
<p>You can see that in this case the responsible has also given you a
reason for his rejection.</p>
<p>In both cases (accept and reject), you as the creator of the event
will receive an email notification.</p>
<p>You can also come back to the page to check on the status, or if
you don&#8217;t want to reload the page, use the <img alt="image0" src="../../_images/html_4108b437.png" /> button to
reload / update the status.</p>
<p>Even after a request is accepted or rejected, you can still modify
it, which will trigger another mail being sent to the responsible.</p>
<p><em>Note: Once the request is accepted, the manager will need to send to every speaker that
will be recorded an email asking to accept some conditions. This will be done through the
Electronic Agreement tab. More details are available in the</em> <a class="reference external" href="#the-electronic-agreement-system">Electronic Agreement system</a> section.</p>

<h2>3.4.5. The Webcast Request system<a class="headerlink" href="#the-webcast-request-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Webcast Request system can be found under the <em>Webcast Request</em>
tab.</p>
<p>The requester can only send one Webcast Request for each Indico
Event, although after sending it, the details can still be
modified.</p>
<p>Every time that a Webcast Request is sent, modified or withdrawn, a
CERN&#8217;s Webcast Responsible will receive a notification email.</p>
<p>A <strong>Webcast</strong> <strong>Responsible</strong> is a person who will be responsible
for webcasting your event, or a person who manages recording
petitions.</p>
<p>Then, the responsible will review the request, and accept or reject
it. The event creator will receive an email notification. If the
request is accepted, your event will be added to Indico&#8217;s list of
events to be webcasted.</p>

<p>To fill in a Webcast Request, go to the <em>Webcast Request</em> tab in
the Video Services section.</p>
<p>You will see a form that you have to fill in.</p>
<p><img alt="figure67" src="../../_images/html_76f03226.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 67. Top part of the <em>Webcast Request</em> form.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, its elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A warning area that may or may not contain warning messages. The
warning messages may be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A warning message to remind you that you need to book your room in
Indico&#8217;s Room Booking system.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You need to select a room capable of webcasting for your Indico
event or at least one of your talks (a talk is a contribution
within a session that is not a Poster session). Some rooms at CERN
have the necessary equipment to webcast an event, and others do
not.</p>
<p>If you get this warning, you can click on
<em>See list of webcast-able rooms</em> to see which rooms have been
marked as webcast-able. This is how the warning looks:</p>

this case, the rest of the form will be disabled and you will not
be able to fill it in.</p>

<li><p class="first">First, you may select among two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">To have all the webcast-able talks of your event webcasted. A talk
is webcast-able if it takes place in a room that has been marked as
webcast-able.</p>
<p>Here, you will be notified if some of your talks are not
webcast-able. Such a situation is shown below:</p>
