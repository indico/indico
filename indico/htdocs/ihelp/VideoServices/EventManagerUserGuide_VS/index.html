1. Introduction</h1>



<p class="normal-text-western">


Indico now allows event managers to
book and program videoconferences associated to their events. For
example, the EVO and CERNMCU systems can be used. Then, other Indico
users can see information about these videoconferences in the public
pages of the events.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


Event managers can now also perform
service requests by filling out forms that now appear inside Indico's
event management interface. Examples of such requests are the
<i>


Recording Request</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">


 and the
</span>


<i>


Webcast Request</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">


.</span>


</p>



<p style="font-style: normal" class="normal-text-western">


Three
different kind of Indico users can make use of this functionality:</p>



<ul>



	<li>


<p style="font-style: normal" class="normal-text-western">


The
	creator of an event.</p>



	<li>


<p style="font-style: normal" class="normal-text-western">


An
	event manager appointed by the creator of the event (or another
	manager).</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<span style="font-style: normal">


A
	Video Services manager, appointed by the event creator or one of the
	event managers. These users have privileges to access the </span>


<i>


Video
	Servicesi </i>


<span style="font-style: normal">


section but cannot
	access any other section in the event management interface.</span>


</p>



</ul>



<p class="normal-text-western">


After an event is created, the
management interface of an Indico event is similar to figure 1:</p>



<p style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.2cm; background: transparent; font-weight: medium; page-break-before: auto;text-align: center;">

The </span>

</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


Your event should have a <i>


Video

 section (marked in orange), unless the Indico
administrators have deactivated all the Video Services systems for
your kind of event (Lecture, Meeting, or Conference) or for all kind
of events.</p>

</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


You should see several tabs. Only tabs
corresponding to systems enabled for your kind of event (Lecture,
Meeting, Conference) will appear. In the above image, the tabs are:
<i>


Videoconferencing</i>


, <i>


Recording</i>


 <i>


Request</i>


, <i>


Webcast</i>



<i>


Request</i>


 and <i>


Managers</i>


.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


The <i>


Managers</i>


 tab is always
present and lets you appoint other people so that they have rights to
manage part of, or all of, the <i>


Video Services</i>


 section. We will
talk about the <i>


Managers</i>


 tab later.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


The other tabs group the different
Video Services systems. At the time this guide was written, there are
four of such systems: EVO and CERNMCU (both Video Conference systems
grouped under the <i>


Videoconferencing</i>


 tab), Recording Request
and Webcast Request.</p>

3. Video Services system types</h1>



<p class="normal-text-western">


There are two types of systems:
<i>


booking</i>


 systems and <i>


request</i>


 systems.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


Booking</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">



systems let you book resources in videoconferencing systems, such as
virtual meeting room in EVO or a videoconference in CERN's MCU.</span>


</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


Request</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">



systems let you request services for your event, such as requesting
that your event is recorded (</span>


<i>


Recording Request)</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">



or webcasted (</span>


<i>


Webcast Request)</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">

<h2 class="western">


<a name="31 Booking systems">


</a>


3.1. Booking
systems</h2>



<p class="normal-text-western">


EVO and CERNMCU are <i>


booking</i>



systems. They let you make a videoconference booking in EVO or CERN's
MCU associated to your event. You can make more than one booking of
each type for your Indico Event.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


This chapter of the guide discusses
common functions of both systems. For more details about how to
manage booking for the EVO system in particular, see chapter <a href="#41 The EVO system">


4.1.</a>



For more details about CERNMCU bookings, please see chapter <a href="#42The CERNMCU system">


4.2.</a>


</p>



<h3 class="western">


3.1.1. Creating a booking</h3>



<p class="normal-text-western">


To create a booking, select a system
(EVO or CERNMCU) and click <i>


Create</i>


.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.2cm; background: transparent; font-weight: medium; page-break-before: auto;text-align: center;">

<p class="image-title-western">


Figure 3. Creating an EVO booking<span style="font-style: normal">

</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


A pop-up dialog will appear, asking
you for data. This pop-up has two tabs: <i>


Basic</i>


 and <i>


Advanced</i>


.
The <i>


Basic</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">


 tab contains the
basic, important data that you need to fill out in order to make a
booking.</span>

<p class="normal-text-western">


After you have filled in the fields,
press the <i>


Save</i>


 button. If there is a mistake with any of the
fields, they will be highlighted in red. For example, in figure 6
below, there are two problems: the description is empty and the end
date of the booking is before the start date (which is unreasonable).</p>

Figure 6. <span style="font-style: normal">


While
creating a booking, some fields were highlighted in red in order to
point out mistakes.</span>

If there were no mistakes, please wait
until the booking is created in the EVO system or the CERNMCU system.</p>



<h3 style="page-break-before: always" class="western">


3.1.2. List of
bookings</h3>



<p class="normal-text-western">


After you have created the booking, it
will appear under <i>


Current Bookings</i>


. In figure 7 below, two
bookings have been created already. As you can see, the most recently
created or modified booking is highlighted in yellow for some
seconds.</p>



<p style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.2cm; background: transparent; font-weight: medium; page-break-before: auto;text-align: center;">

Figure 7. <span style="font-style: normal">

	start the booking; or maybe an administrator of EVO / CERNMCU has
	deleted your booking for some reason.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">

systems</h2>



<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


Recording Request</i>

 are <i>


request</i>


 systems.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


Instead of performing a booking in a
videoconference system, such as EVO or CERN's MCU, these parts of the
Video Services section are useful to request a service for your
event.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


You can only perform one request of
each type for your Indico Event, although you can change its details
after you send it.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


Click on the <i>


Recording Request</i>



or <i>


Webcast Request</i>


 tabs to request these services. You will
have to fill in a form for this request.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


By filling in these forms, you are
requesting a CERN Recording expert to come and record your event, or
a CERN Webcast expert to webcast your event.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


These forms are very detailed and
their purpose is to facilitate the communication between you and the
Recording / Webcast services. Please take some time to fill them
correctly as that will save both you and the services' responsibles
valuable time.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


We will discuss the details of the
Recording Request form and the Webcast Request form later, in
chapters <a href="#43 The Recording Request system">


4.3.</a>


 and <a href="#44 The Webcast Request system">


4.4.</a>



The common parts to both forms are found at their top and bottom:
they are the buttons to  send / modify / withdraw the request.

In summary, you should add someone as
Video Services Manager if you want to give that person great control
over the Video Services section, including appointing other Video

Figure 28. <span style="font-style: normal">



In the EVO booking creation dialog, some fields were highlighted in
red in order to point out mistakes.</span>


</p>



<p style="page-break-before: always" class="normal-text-western">


Situations
where this can happen:</p>



<ul>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


You left the meeting title
	empty</i>


. The title field will be highlighted in red.</p>



	<li>

<i>

. The description field will be highlighted in
	red.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The start time is too soon</i>


.
	The start time field will be highlighted in red, and if you hover
	the mouse over it the reason for the problem will be shown. This can
	happen for two reasons:</p>



	<ul>



		<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The start time is under the
		limit of your Indico Event start time</i>


 (currently the limit is
		60 min before the Indico Event start time)</p>



		<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The start time is in the
		past</i>


. For example, if your clock shows that it's 4pm, you will
		not be able to create a meeting that starts at 3pm of the same day
		(or a previous day). The allowed margin is 30 min (so 3.30pm would
		be  allowed).</p>



	</ul>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The ending time is too late</i>


.
	The ending time field will be highlighted in red. The ending time
	cannot be more than 60 min after the ending time of the Indico
	event.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The ending time is in the
	past</i>


. The ending time field will be highlighted in red.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The ending time is before the
	start time</i>


<span style="font-style: normal">


.</span>


 Both fields
	will be highlighted in red.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


EVO considers the booking as
	duplicated. This happens if your booking has the same title and very
	similar (around 5 min) start and end times as a pre-existing
	booking. In this case, you will get a warning dialog and the title,
	start time and end time fields will be highlighted in red. Try to
	change either the title or the times to get rid of this problem.</p>



</ul>



<p class="normal-text-western">


Problems when you arrive to the
Collaboration tab or when you update the status:</p>



<ul>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The booking has been deleted
	by EVO</i>


. It is possible that the administrators of the EVO system
	have deleted your booking for some reason. Indico checks this and
	informs you if it's the case. This occurrence should be very rare.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


<i>


The booking's data has been
	changed by EVO</i>


. It is possible that the administrators of the
	EVO system have modified your booking for some reason (maybe the

4.2. The CERNMCU system</h2>



<p class="normal-text-western">


The CERNMCU system lets you book
videoconferences in CERN's MCU. This allows you to enjoy multi-point
videoconferences between rooms and people equipped with an H.323
camera. Indico will allow you to pre-define a list of remote
participants (typically, CERN rooms).</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


Videoconferences booked in this way
through Indico can be started and stopped through Indico as well.
Indico will tell CERN's MCU to connect all the pre-defined remote
participants and start a videoconference. However, other persons or
rooms can join the videoconference by following the instructions
generated with each boking.</p>

4.2.2.6.
Effect of changing the participants of an ongoing conference</i>


</h3>



<p class="normal-text-western">


If you are creating the CERN MCU
booking, or modifying it before the conference has been started,
there are no special consequences.</p>



<p class="normal-text-western">


However, if you have already started
the conference by pressing the

Start</i>


), changing the participants will have some
consequences on the ongoing conference. Everything works the way
common sense dictates, and here are the details:</p>



<ul>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


If you add a new participant
	while the conference is ongoing, the new participant will be
	connected to the videoconference immediately.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


If you remove a participant while
	the conference is ongoing, that participant will be disconnected
	from the videoconference.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


If you edit a participant and
	change its name (for a room), family and first name (for a person),
	institution, etc., then the displayed name of the participant, as
	seen by all the other participants, will change.</p>



	<li>


<p class="normal-text-western">


If you edit a participant and
	change its endpoint IP, the old IP will be disconnected, and Indico
	will attempt to connect the new endpoint IP to the conference.</p>

Webcast Responsible will be notified by mail that your request has
been withdrawn.</p>

Webcast Request form will return to its initial state; all the fields
will be empty.</p>
