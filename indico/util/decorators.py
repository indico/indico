def smart_decorator(f):
    """Decorator to make decorators work both with and without arguments.

    This decorator allows you to use a decorator both without arguments::

        @fancy_decorator
        def function():
            pass

    And also with arguments::

        @fancy_decorator(123, foo='bar')
        def function():
            pass

    The only limitation is that the decorator itself MUST NOT allow a callable object
    as the first positional argument, unless there is at least one other mandatory argument.

    The decorator decorated with `smart_decorator` obviously needs to have default values for
    all arguments but the first one::

        @smart_decorator
        def requires_location(f, some='args', are='here'):
            @wraps(f)
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
