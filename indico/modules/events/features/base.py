class EventFeature(object):
    """Base class for event features.

    To create a new feature, subclass this class and register
    it using the `event.get_feature_definitions` signal.
    Feature classes are never instatiated.

    You have multiple ways of requiring a feature to be enabled:

    If you simply want to run some code if a feature is (not) enabled,
    use ``event.has_feature('feature')`` to check it.  This is
    especially useful in signal handlers, but make sure you only check
    the feature for signals where it makes sense.  For example, you
    probably want to handle ``event.deleted`` no matter if the feature
    is enabled or not (as it might have been enabled before).

    If a blueprint has no endpoints that need to work without the
    feature enabled, set the ``event_feature`` kwarg of
    `IndicoBlueprint` to the name of your feature.  This will make any
    request to that blueprint fail with an error unless the feature is
    enabled.

    If you only want to certain RHs to require a feature, you can set
    their ``EVENT_FEATURE`` class attribute to the name of your feature.
    The behavior in case of a disabled feature is the same as for
    blueprint-level features.
