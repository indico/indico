    """Get the default booking interval for a room.

    Returns the default booking interval for a room as a tuple containing
    the start and end times as `datetime` objects.

    The start time is the default working start time or the current time (if the
    working start time is in the past); rounded up to the given precision in
    minutes (15 by default).

    The end time corresponds to the start time plus the given duration in
    minutes. If the booking ends after the end of work time, it is
    automatically moved to the next day.

    :param duration: int -- The duration of a booking in minutes (must be
        greater than 1)
    :param precision: int -- The number of minutes by which to round up the
        current time for the start time of a booking. Negative values are
        allowed but will round the time down and create a booking starting in
        the past.
    :param force_today: Forces a booking to be for today, even if it past the
        end of work time. This is ignored if the current time is either after
        23:50 or within the amount of minutes of the precision from midnight.
        For example with a precision of 30 minutes, if the current time is 23:42
        then the meeting will be the following day.
    :returns: (datetime, datetime, bool) -- A tuple with the start and end times
        of the booking and a boolean which is `True` if the date was changed
        from today and `False` otherwise.
