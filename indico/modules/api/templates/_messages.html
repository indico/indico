{% macro get_enable_persistent_msg() -%}
    {%- trans -%}
        Enabling persistent signatures will allow signed requests without a timestamp.
        This means that the same link can be used forever to access private information.
        This introduces the risk that if somebody finds out about the link, they can access
        the same private information as yourself. By enabling this you agree to keep those links
        private and ensure that no unauthorized people will use them.

        When disabling persistent signatures, all signed requests need a valid timestamp again.
        If you enable them again, old persistent links will start working again - if you need to
        invalidate them, you have to create a new API key!

        In order to enable an iCal export link, your account needs to have an API key created.
        This key enables other applications to access data from within Indico even when you are
        neither using nor logged into the Indico system yourself with the link provided.
        Once created, you can manage your key at any time by going to 'My Profile' and looking
        under the tab entitled 'HTTP API'. Further information about HTTP API keys can be found
        in the Indico documentation.

{% macro get_ical_persistent_msg() -%}

        Additionally to having an API key associated with your account, exporting private event
        information requires the usage of a persistent signature. This enables API URLs which do
        not expire after a few minutes so while the setting is active, anyone in possession of the
        link provided can access the information. Due to this, it is extremely important that you keep
        these links private and for your use only. If you think someone else may have acquired access
        to a link using this key in the future, you must immediately create a new key pair on the
        'My Profile' page under the 'HTTP API' and update the iCalendar links afterwards.
