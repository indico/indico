{% macro get_enable_persistent_msg() -%}
    {%- trans -%}
        Enabling persistent signatures will allow signed requests without a timestamp.
        This means that the same link can be used forever to access private information.
        This introduces the risk that if somebody finds out about the link, they can access
        the same private information as yourself. By enabling this you agree to keep those links
        private and ensure that no unauthorized people will use them.

{% macro get_disable_persistent_msg() -%}
    {%- trans -%}
        When disabling persistent signatures, all signed requests need a valid timestamp again.
        If you enable them again, old persistent links will start working again - if you need to
        invalidate them, you have to create a new API key!
